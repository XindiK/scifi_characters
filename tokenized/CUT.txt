EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY
The helicopter flies over the lip of a WATERFALL, revealing a
valley.
The valley floor is a forest, and a single bright green
meadow. Sunlit, like a jewel in the icy mountains.
A white-water river runs through it.
7                                                                    7
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
CALEB looks down at the breathtaking view as the helicopter
banks, turns, and descends.
8                                                                    8
EXT. MEADOW/LANDING SITE - DAY
Meadow flowers whip in the rotor wash as the helicopter
touches down in the vast meadow.
By the landing site is a collection of huge metal crates.
All have Chinese characters on the side.
The rotor blades slow, but don't stop.
JAY exits.
9                                                                    9
EXT. MEADOW/LANDING SITE - DAY
JAY holds open the door as CALEB exits the helicopter cabin.
CALEB looks around, his eyes adjusting to the bright sunshine
outside.
JAY goes to the side of the helicopter, pops open a hatch,
and removes CALEB'S luggage. A large suitcase with wheels.
CALEB looks around. Apart from the packing crates, there are
no man-made structures to be seen.
CALEB shouts over the engine noise.
24                                                                    24
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
CALEB stands in his boxer shorts, brushing his teeth by the
sink.
REVEAL several long scars on his back.
Neat. Unusual.      Long-healed.   But from serious wounds, or
surgery.
25                                                                    25

INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Darkness.
The clock reads 01:32 am.
The soft glow from the digital readout throws a light on the
remote control.
28.
REVEAL CALEB.
Eyes closed.    For a beat.
Then his eyes open.   He's wide awake.
He turns over in the bed.
Then turns back again.
CUT TO -
2:28 am.
CALEB lies watching the digital clock, as the numbers change
to 2:29 am.
36                                                               36
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
CALEB stands in shorts, in front of the sink, having a shave.
He leans forwards into the mirror, as if checking to make
sure he shaved properly on his cheek.
46.
And he hears the noise again.   The servo, making a tiny
corrective movement.
CALEB catches his own gaze in the mirror.
Then he deliberately steps sideways, and turns his head.
Ostensibly to check the other cheek. But actually to have
shifted his position.
And he hears the noise again.
Very faint.   But definitely there.
A micro beat.
Then CALEB pulls back and continues shaving.
Not giving any outward indication that he has just figured
out that there is a camera behind the bathroom mirror.
37                                                                37
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Clean-shaved, CALEB walks into his bedroom.
On the TV, the live feed of AVA'S room is playing - though
she is not in shot.
Subtly, CALEB'S gaze flicks to different points around the
room.
To the full-length mirror on the wall.
The high vent for the air-conditioning system.
The TV itself.
CALEB hesitates for a moment.
Then pulls on a T-Shirt.   Picks up his ID card.   And exits.
CUT TO -
- the TV.
AVA walks in to the locked-off CCTV shot.
She walks towards an induction plate, rests her hand against
it, and starts charging herself.
As she does so, almost imperceptibly, the lights dim, and a
slight static charge passes over the television screen.
38                                                                38
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
CALEB walks along the glass corridor.
47.
Systematically trying his ID CARD on the doors he passes.
He tries one.
Then another.    Then another.   Then another.
Every single door remains locked.
39                                                                39
INT. HOUSE/CABIN - NIGHT
CALEB enters a small room with a view over the river and
garden.
It is virtually the only room apart from his own that he
seems able to gain access to.
The lights are all off. The room is only lit by the
moonlight through the sliding glass wall, and lanterns in the
garden.
He starts walking towards the glass wall.
Then stops.
On the patio, NATHAN is working the punch bag.
KYOKO stands a few feet away from him, holding a white towel.
With the glass wall closed, no noise of the impacts
penetrates into the room.
CALEB watches.
NATHAN'S attack on the bag seems strange. More extreme than
the hard workout we saw the first time he was using the bag.
This seems brutal.   Almost frenzied.
For a few moments, the attack on the bag is observed in
silence, from inside the main room.
We can only hear the sound of CALEB'S breathing.

40                                                                40
EXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - NIGHT
- the punch bag, and a sudden explosion of noise.   Of impacts
and exertions.
Blood smearing the leather where it has soaked through the
knuckle wraps.
Then -
- BANG.
48.
A particularly hard right hook connects, and splits the bag.
CUT TO -
41                                                                41
INT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - NIGHT
- CALEB.   Watching.
Coloured strips of ribbon are visible through the split in
the bag.
NATHAN stands, catching his breath.
Then he reaches out a hand.
KYOKO hands him the towel.
NATHAN wipes his face.
Then reaches out again, this time catching KYOKO'S arm.
He pulls her towards him, and starts to kiss her.
Reaching under her shirt.
Pulling her skirt up over her thighs.
42                                                                42
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S ROOM - NIGHT
CALEB re-enters his room, and closes the door.
After a beat, the lights in the corridor fade out.
43                                                                43
EXT. MOUNTAINS - NIGHT
The moon hangs in the sky.

INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - BLACK AND WHITE
Everything in the frame is black and white.
CLOSE UP on AVA'S meticulous abstract pictures, scattered on
a table.
CALEB is looking at them.
REVEAL he is in the observation room.
But he is on AVA'S side of the glass.
And AVA is on his side. Seen through the opaque glass that
divides the private area from the observation area.
49.
48                                                                48
EXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - MORNING
- a brand new punch bag hangs in the patio.   Swinging
slightly in the breeze.
49                                                                49
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
CALEB and AVA face each other.
50.
AVA is holding up a piece of paper to the glass.
72                                                                72
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
CALEB helps NATHAN into his bedroom.
They walk past a semi-circle line of long cabinets, which
line the wall opposite the bed.
They are like a row of slender wardrobes, each with a
mirrored door.
Once he's reached the bed, NATHAN tips towards it. It's
almost as if he's asleep before he even hits the sheets.
77.
As he leaves, CALEB glimpses Nathan's study.
73                                                                73
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
CALEB'S room.    Lit only by the glow of the television.
CALEB is not in the bed. He's on the armchair.    Making
himself stay awake. Watching over AVA -
- who stands in her room, against the wall, facing away from
the CCTV camera, with her arms wrapped around herself.
74                                                                74

INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
CALEB and AVA sit, observing each other through their own
reflections.
77                                                              77

EXT. HOUSE/CABIN - DAY
NATHAN and CALEB sit, each holding a bottle of Peroni,
watching the water cloud.
Eventually, CALEB speaks.
89                                                                  89

INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
CALEB enters NATHAN'S bedroom.
KYOKO is lying on NATHAN'S bed.
She's naked.    On her back.   Legs open.
Her head turns as CALEB enters.
But apart from that, she doesn't react.
CALEB walks to the line of long mirrored cabinets opposite
the bed.
He hesitates.
Then pulls the first door open.
LILY is inside. Standing upright.     Gazing back at him,
frozen, blank eyed.
CALEB goes to the next door and opens it.
He sees a slender black girl, whose limbs are robotic, but
whose torso and head are synthetic.
He opens another door, and another, and another.
Then steps back, into the middle of the room, and gazes at
the line of android girls.
90.
Stunned.
The camera drifts away from him.
Then settles.
In the multiple reflections of the open mirror doors, we can
see KYOKO'S naked and sexually receptive form on the bed
behind him.
Like an infinity reflection in a hall of mirrors.
91                                                                 91

INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
CALEB stands above KYOKO'S naked form.
He reaches out a hand.
She takes it.
He gently pulls her to a standing position.
Then he moves her arms away from her body...
... and sees, running under her arms in a straight contour,
over her ribs, there is a faint line.
He touches it with his finger.
KYOKO steps back.
But it's not a defensive action.    It's just to give her
space...
... as she reaches under her arm, and adjusts something
unseen. And a moment later, the faint line that runs down
each side of her torso is opening. As if unzipping.
Then KYOKO puts a hand either side of her torso, and pulls
off the skin covering over her entire chest, in a single
section from her collar bone, over the breasts, to her solar
plexus.
Revealing underneath the honeycomb mesh and her robot form.
93                                                                 93
INT. HOUSE/CONCRETE STAIRCASE - NIGHT
On the monitor screens, apparently unnoticed by CALEB, NATHAN
is on the live CCTV feed.
Making his way along the mezzanine.

INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
- CALEB.
Transfixed, as KYOKO now reaches around the back of her head.
And finds something on the back of her head, at the nape of
her neck, inside her hairline.
Which unzips the skin around her jaw.
Allowing her to remove her face.
95                                                                 95
INT. HOUSE/DINING ROOM/ELEVATOR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
NATHAN uses the glass wall to support himself.
He reaches his door.
Then sticks his hand in his pocket for his KEYCARD.
But it isn't there.
He checks his other pocket.
102                                                              102
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
AVA sits alone in the observation room.
The door opens.
CALEB appears, wearing a long-sleeved shirt.
Enters.
He sits opposite her, on the other side of the dividing
glass.
A strange noise escapes from AVA'S mouth.
A kind of sob.
Curtailed.
124                                                                124
EXT. MEADOW/LANDING SITE - DAY
The helicopter touches down.
The rotors stop.
And the PILOT climbs out.
Takes off his helmet.
Looks at the girl standing a few metres away.
Nothing betrays that AVA is anything other than a pretty girl
in her early twenties.
AVA turns as he approaches her.

EXT. MEADOW/LANDING SITE - DAY
- AVA'S precise POINT OF VIEW.
Looking at the PILOT.
The image echoes the POV views from the computer/cell-phone
cameras in the opening moments of the film.
Facial recognition vectors flutter around the PILOT'S face.
And when he opens his mouth to speak, we don't hear words.
We hear pulses of monotone noise.   Low pitch.   Speech as pure
pattern recognition.
This is how AVA sees us.   And hears us.
It feels completely alien.
126                                                              126
EXT. MEADOW - DAY
AVA and the PILOT finish talking.
We are too distant to hear their conversation.
But whatever is said, a few beats later, the PILOT goes the
helicopter and opens the passenger door, to allow AVA to
enter.
Then he goes back to the PILOT'S door.
Gets in.
And the rotor blades start to turn.

In the crowd, we glimpse AVA.    Just for a moment.
