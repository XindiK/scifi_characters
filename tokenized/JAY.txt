You fell asleep almost as soon as
we left the airport.
CALEB looks around.   Wipes sleep out of his eyes.   Gets his
bearings.
You're a programmer, right?
Bay facility?
Algorithms. Nice.
Nope. But I knew you were a
programmer. Soon as I set eyes on
you.
Means you and Mr Bateman speak the
same language. I'd say that's a
good thing.
Beat.
I've never even met him. I only
fly this shuttle between the
airport and his residence.

JAY (CONT'D)
I did see him one time. Stood on
one of these mountain ridges.
JAY shrugs.
JAY (CONT'D)
Assume it was him, anyway. No one
else around for a hundred miles.
JAY glances over at CALEB.
JAY (CONT'D)
So how does a programmer from Long
Island get to be meeting the CEO?
The president can't get Mr Bateman
on the phone, but you got the
golden ticket.
Hell of an opportunity.
Alaska.   Most beautiful place on
Earth.
Beat.
We've been flying over his estate
for the past two hours.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY
The helicopter flies over a vast white glacier.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY
This is as close as I'm allowed to
the building.
Follow the river.
JAY hands CALEB his bag.
JAY (CONT'D)
Please get a safe distance from the
blades.
The pilot gets back inside the helicopter, and closes the
door.
CALEB hurriedly retreats with his bag.
Moments later, in a roar of wind and noise, the helicopter is
lifting off.
Equally suddenly, the noise is fading, and the helicopter is
soaring upwards, and banking back towards the glacier.
Then it is gone.    Bird song and wind rush replace engine
noise.
CALEB suddenly looks very isolated.

EXT. RIVER - DAY
CALEB walks along the banks of the fast-flowing river,
awkwardly bumping his wheeled suitcase over the ground.
The banks of the river start to climb, to an intimidating
drop.
It feels that this can't be the right way.
CALEB reaches into his pocket and pulls out his mobile phone.
No signal at all.
He puts his phone back in his pocket.

EXT. RIVER/HOUSE VIEW - DAY
CALEB rounds a bend in the river.
Ahead, almost hidden in trees, there is a steel and glass
structure.

EXT. CLEARING - DAY
CALEB walks towards the house through the trees.
In the ground, in a grassy clearing, he finds a circular
window, reflecting the sky.
He walks up to the window, and looks inside.
It reveals what is effectively a glass-covered well - about
four metres deep, with smooth concrete sides.
At the bottom of the well is a brightly-lit room, which
appears to be an office of some sort. There is a desk, with
monitors, and a chair.
But apparently no one inside.
Beyond the clearing, in the tree-line, CALEB sees - almost
camouflaged by forest - the dark shapes and straight lines of
a low, one storey building complex.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY
CALEB approaches the building.
As he nears the entrance -
- CALEB startles, as an AUTOMATED VOICE speaks to him, from
an unknown source.
