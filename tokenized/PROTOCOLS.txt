In the windows, lines of code appear as CALEB types.
84                                                                84
INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
In the main room, on the floor, NATHAN stirs.
85                                                                85
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
On the MONITORS -
- the windows start to collapse.
Leaving the default screen.    The waterfall wallpaper.
CALEB reaches for NATHAN'S KEYCARD, and is about to remove it
from the slot -
- when something makes him hesitate.
His eyes have gone to the folder icon on the right hand side
of the screen.
It is titled DEUS EX MACHINA.
CALEB removes his hand from the keycard.
He double-clicks the folder.
It expands into a window, which contains a long list of sub-
folders.
Each sub-folder is named after a girl.
JASMINE, KATYA, JADE, LILY, AMBER, KYOKO, and AVA.
86                                                                86
INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
In the main room, NATHAN has sat up, and is unsteadily trying
to get to his feet.
88.
87                                                               87
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
CALEB randomly clicks one of the girl's names.    LILY.
LILY'S folder expands into a window, stacked with thumbnail
images of a girl.
CALEB clicks on one of the images at random.
CUT TO -
- a CCTV film-clip starting to play.
It shows LILY - an android of similar design to AVA - sitting
with her head bowed. Rocking backwards and forwards, in a
gently autistic motion.
In the corner of the room, NATHAN leans against the wall,
watching.
CUT TO -
- CALEB collapsing the LILY menu, and opening KATYA.
CUT TO -
A new film clip.
KATYA.   Who is limp.   Lifeless.
NATHAN is dragging her towards the induction plate.    He holds
her up, trying to force her to charge.
But nothing happens.
NATHAN drops KATYA, and she folds to the floor.
CUT TO -
CALEB opening JADE.
CUT TO -
The next film clip.
NATHAN stands in the glass box inside the observation room -
- watching JADE.   A beautiful Asian android girl.
They are talking, but we hear no audio.   Some kind of
argument, which escalates fast.
JADE starts shouting.
Then she approaches the glass and starts to hit her hands
against it.
The glass doesn't break.
89.
One of JADE'S arms has broken under the force of the blows.
The hand flails limply where the carbon fibre has splintered
at the wrist.
Then the other breaks.
Throughout, NATHAN simply watches impassively.
88                                                                  88
INT. HOUSE/STAIRCASE - NIGHT
NATHAN has managed to get to his feet.
He makes his way up the concrete staircase.
88A                                                                88A
