Dialogue:
 She's an extraordinary piece of engineering.  Proportioned as a slender female in her twenties, her limbs and torso are a mixture of metal and plastic and carbon fibre.  The carbon fibre is charcoal colour. The plastic is cream. The metal has the yellow-warmth of nickel.  The shapes of her body approximate the form of muscle.   There are biceps, and breasts. Her hands have five delicate digits.  Her body-structure is covered in a delicate skin. The skin is a mesh, in the pattern of a honeycomb. Like a spiderweb, it is almost invisible unless side-lit.  The one part of her that is not obviously an inorganic construct is her face - which is that of a strikingly beautiful girl. Created in a defined oval, from the top of the forehead to just below her chin. Indistinguishable from a real girl in its appearance and in the way it moves - except for one thing.  There is a very slight, almost imperceptible blankness in her eyes.  19.    back of her head, which obscures the glass orb and jellyfish structure.  Then -  - she half turns. As if having become aware of another presence in the room.     The main area is the OBSERVATION ROOM. A large area, arranged around a glass box, from which she can be viewed.  At the back of the observation room, behind a sheet of semi- opaque glass, is the PRIVATE AREA. This contains a bed-like structure, a desk, a wardrobe, and a mirror. And behind the private area is the GARDEN AREA. This is a small decorative indoor garden, lit by lamps. The garden is  There are also several oval discs positioned around the room, made of some kind of dark non-reflective material. These are induction plates.  And there is a chair, which faces the glass observation box.  And facing that chair, inside the observation box, is another chair.  engineering: how she moves. The unconscious precision of her steps. The fluidity of her action.   Hello.  20.    Her voice has no digital inflections.    It is just the voice of a girl.   Who are you?    Hello, Caleb.    Yes.     Ava.   I'm pleased to meet you too.    Are you nervous?     Are you nervous?  21.      Why?    I feel nervous too.    Yes.    I've never met anyone new before. Only Nathan.    Haven't you met lots of new people before?    Oh.  Beat.    Yes.    Overcome initial social awkwardness.  22.    Beat.    Okay. What would you like to have a conversation about?    What would you like to know?      Well. You already know my name. And you can see that I'm a machine. Would you like to know how old I am?    I'm one.    One.   Does that seem young to you?   time.  23.      I don't think I did learn. I always knew how to speak - and that's strange, isn't it?    Because language is something that people acquire.    ... I don't know.       I have no opinion on that.  Beat.    I like to draw.     I don't have any of my pictures with me now, but I can show you them tomorrow.    Yes.  Beat.    Will you come back tomorrow, Caleb?   And suddenly -  - there is a strong sense of something very human there.    In the way the smile lights up her face.    Good.   21                                                                21   Drawing.    The different TV channels flip between feeds from the various cameras.  drawing.    I brought you a drawing.  totally abstract. A mesh of tiny black marks, that swirl around the page like iron filings in magnetic field patterns.    Don't you know?     Oh.   I thought you would tell me.    I do drawings every day. But I never know what they're of.    Okay.   What object should I draw?    Why is it my decision?    36.      Do you want to be my friend?    Will it be possible?    Our conversations are one-sided. You ask circumspect questions, and study my responses.   It's true, isn't it?   You learn about me, and I learn nothing about you. That's not a foundation on which friendships are based.   Yes.    Yes.    It's your decision. I'm interested to see what you'll choose.    Blue Book, named after Wittgenstein's notes, is the world's most popular internet search engine, processing an average of ninety four percent of all internet search requests.    Where do you live, Caleb?    Is it nice there?    Are you married?    Is your status single?    What about your family?      I'm sorry.   An advanced programmer.    Like Nathan.    Do you like Mozart?   Do you like Nathan?   Is Nathan your friend?    A good friend?  He hesitates.   mesh that we were not able to see before.  It glows, soft, like phosphorescence - and this changes the conditions, it is now the dominant describer of her form. So see the curves and lines of a naked female body.      Caleb.   You're wrong.    Nathan.    He isn't your friend.    You shouldn't trust him. You shouldn't trust anything he says.     Trust me.  Then -  - the emergency lighting suddenly dims...  ... and the normal lighting starts fading up.   - and if we made a list of books or works of art which we both know, it would form the ideal basis of a discussion.  A beat.    Is that okay, Caleb? They lock eyes for a moment.      Good.   33                                                                33  she is not in shot.   She walks towards an induction plate, rests her hand against it, and starts charging herself.  As she does so, almost imperceptibly, the lights dim, and a slight static charge passes over the television screen.   38                                                                38  a table.   divides the private area from the observation area.  49.      She locks eyes with him.  Smiles.  He starts to walk towards her.   resting form.  Then reaches for the remote control on the bedside table, and switches the TV off.      I drew the picture of something specific, as you asked.  The drawing is constructed with the same tiny black ink marks as before. But now they have ordered into a coherent black and white image.   Beat.    You said it would be interesting to see what I would draw. Is it interesting?    No.    I've never been outside the room I am in now.     I think there was another room in which I was constructed. But I have no memory of it, so it's similar to your relationship with the womb.    You mean if I could go outside.    If I was permitted.   I'm not sure. There are so many options.  Beat.    Maybe a busy pedestrian and traffic intersection in a city.   Is that a bad idea?    A traffic intersection would provide a concentrated but shifting view of human life.    Yes.  Beat.    We could go together.    There's something else I wanted to show you. Apart from the picture.    But I feel nervous.    You might think it's stupid.      Then - close your eyes.   observation room.    In the PRIVATE AREA, she opens a wardrobe space, which reveals clothes, and a hair-piece.  Then she starts to get dressed.  First a summer dress.  Then stockings.  Then a long-sleeved cardigan.  She checks her reflection in the mirror, and adjusts the clothes slightly. Making sure that as much of her robot form is covered as possible.  Then she puts on the hair-piece.     Short, brown hair.  Finally, she makes a subtle adjustment to her face. Similar to putting on make-up, she adjusts the intensity of her own skin tones. Her lips redden. Her cheeks blush slightly. A discreet line of black extends like mascara around her eyes.    Now open your eyes.   Transformed.  By covering the robot form of her chest and arms and legs, and adding the hairpiece, she has taken a huge visual step towards appearing human.    How do I look?  The answer is - however pretty she looked before, she now looks prettier. It's as obvious to the camera as it is to   It took me a long time to select these clothes. I tried different colours and styles, and tried to anticipate your reaction. Do you think the choices suit me?    Do they bring out my best features?      Thank you.  She walks back to the glass divider, and sits down.    This is what I'd wear on our date.   I'd like us to go on a date.   Are you attracted to me?  Beat.   It was loaded exactly as it sounded.    Are you attracted to me? You give indications that you are.    Yes.    Micro expressions.    The way your eyes fix on my eyes, and lips. The way you hold my gaze, or don't.  Beat.    Have I read them incorrectly?   Do you think about me when we aren't together?  Beat.  55.      Sometimes, at night, I wonder if you're watching me on the cameras.   And I hope you are.   Now your micro expressions are telegraphing discomfort.    I don't want to make you uncomfortable. Silence.   50                                                              50   She is wearing the summer dress she put on earlier.  Checking her reflection from different angles.  Subtly girlish.    Unself-conscious. Then -  - she starts to take the dress off.  in an unclothed form. But now - having been clothed - the undressing seems to make her naked.  And the act itself feels charged. Sexualised, in the way the clothing is unbuttoned, and dropped, and her shape is revealed.  Finally, once she is completely undressed -   Straight at the camera.        ... No.  Reveal the room.  NATHAN'S study. A simple space. One part analogue: the wall of post-its. One part digital: a desk, in the middle of the STUDY, with a bank of monitors, and a slot - into which NATHAN'S KEYCARD is inserted.   I didn't know. I didn't question it. I was... pleased. To meet you. And then...  Beside the desk, there is a daybed.  On it, KYOKO lies.     Naked.   Apparently sleeping.       What about you? Do you think I have a consciousness?  Long beat.    It makes me feel...  She breaks off.    ... sad.  NOW REVEAL - one of the other monitor screens. viewpoint, we can see something just below the frame of the  A small induction plate.   At that moment -  - the screens simultaneously go black.  All lights die.  Another POWER CUT.  In the reflection from the dark monitor screens, we can see NATHAN'S face.  It remains frozen.   Expressionless.  Then he reaches for his pen.   Jots down a few words on a post- it.  Then walks to the wall of notes, and sticks it on.      You're lying.    You said you weren't sure if I was conscious. But you are sure.  Beat.    I can tell from your micro- expressions.  Beat.   Because he tells lies too.    Everything.    What do you mean?      I charge my batteries   via induction plates. If I reverse    the power flow, I cause a surge   equal to the static discharge of a   lightning strike. It overloads    the system.  69.      She touches it against the glass.    So we can see how we behave when we are unobserved.  A beat.  Torso, hands, mouths.     A moment later NATHAN enters the frame.  There's no volume on the TV, so we can't hear their exchange. Only see it.  touches the side of her cheek. The gesture is not quite neutral. Feels predatory, but not unambiguously so.  Then he tugs at the material of her shirt. Pulling up the sleeve from her wrist. Revealing the robot structure of her arm.   - and NATHAN takes a corrective movement step to regain his balance. Showing that he is drunk.  Only now -  it for a moment.  They exchange a few words.  Then abruptly NATHAN rips drawing in half.      Drops it on the floor. Then turns, and exits.    67                                                                 67   - who stands in her room, against the wall, facing away from the CCTV camera, with her arms wrapped around herself.   74                                                                74   Today, I'm going to test you.    Yes. And please remember while you are taking the test that if you lie, I will know.   Exactly.    So are you ready?    Question one. What is your favourite colour?    Lie.  78.      Lie.    I don't know. But it isn't red.      Better answer. Question two. What's your earliest memory?    Lie.    Yes.    79.      Question three.      Are you a good person?   No. We can't stop.      Are you a good person?       Question four. Who's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?  Beat.    Hmm.  Beat.    The test is over.    Yes.    80.      Why?   Yes.    No.    What will happen to me if I fail your test?    Will it be bad?    Do you think I might be switched off? Because I don't function as well as I am supposed to?    Why is it up to anyone? Do you have people who test you, and might switch you off?    Then why do I?   You're testing me. But you don't know how I'll pass. And you don't know what will happen if I fail.   Then she stands.  Then walks to the other side of the room.    Picks something up from her table.  Then she returns.    Holding two pieces of paper.  She walks up to the glass, and holds them up together.  It's the drawing she was doing last light.   The drawing that NATHAN tore in half.   I want to be with you.  Beat.    Question five. Do you want to be with me?  Beat.    Nathan doesn't want us to be together.  82.      ... Can you?  Watching the door on the other side of the glass, waiting for it to open.  It remains closed.  Beats pass.  Then -  - unexpectedly, it opens.      Revealing a silhouette figure.     Caleb!  No.   Wrong silhouette.   KYOKO stands in the door-frame.  For a moment, the two look at each other.    ... Who are you?  Another beat.   80                                                                   80    86                                                                86  with her head bowed. Rocking backwards and forwards, in a gently autistic motion.  In the corner of the room, NATHAN leans against the wall, watching.     The door opens.   A kind of sob.  Curtailed.    I didn't know where you were. I didn't think you were coming. I waited all yesterday afternoon, and all last night. I didn't move.  Beat.    I thought I wasn't going to see you again.  Beat.    Aren't you going to say something?  95.      Waiting?  They exchange a look.  plate on the console below the window.  A final beat.  Then the POWER DIES.    What's he going to do to me?    Caleb, you have to help me.    What?   How?    Yes.  96.     Twenty six hours.    Caleb.  Beat.    I love y -   But whereas the first time the sound was muted, this time we can hear the audio.      The cameras are on.    Is it strange to have made something that hates you?  A beat.  Then abruptly, NATHAN rips the picture.  He lets the two pieces fall to the floor.   102.    And exits.   107                                                               107   And NATHAN is reaching out with his hand.  And his hand is holding something.   bookcase.  NOTE THAT on the two previous occasions we have seen this clip of film, we will have seen him do this action. But not register it, instead reading the action as him drunkenly using the shelf to steady himself.   What? How?      Where, discretely, the LED by the keycard plate glows blue.   110                                                            110   And on the feed of the GLASS CORRIDOR -   NATHAN freezes as he sees her.    They stand together.   Her lips are open.   They don't move.  CLOSE UP to KYOKO'S lips, we hear a hiss of static, with soft pulses of noise buried inside.  Then the two robot women become aware of NATHAN'S presence.  They turn to face him.  A beat.   NATHAN'S fingers flex around the metal bar in his hand.      She stops walking.  108.      If I do, are you ever going to let me out?  Beat.  CLOSE UP.   NATHAN'S micro expressions.     Sprinting in NATHAN'S direction.   112                                                              112   Then land hard.  NATHAN gets to his feet first.   And he kicks her extremely hard in the torso.  She is knocked back down.  NATHAN glances around.  There is no talking.  Just NATHAN'S laboured breathing.   He swings the metal bar.   - and shockingly, the bar smashes through it. Crushing the delicate mesh, shattering the carbon fibre bone structure. Breaking the arm half way down the forearm.    She pulls the knife out of his back. Feeling this happen, NATHAN turns -    Then takes a slight step away from her.  And sits down heavily on the white carpet.  Crimson drips onto bleached fibre.  Beats pass on this strange image:  KYOKO sprawled on the floor with her broken face.  NATHAN sitting upright, his upper torso now drenched in blood.   After a few moments, NATHAN slumps sideways.  And stops breathing.   113                                                               113   As she walks, she discards the broken section of her arm.  111.      Will you stay here?  Beat.     androids.  She is unclothed.  She gazes at the androids.  Then she removes the arm from JADE, and replaces her own shattered limb.  She takes a moment to see how the new limb looks in the mirrors.  Then she starts removing sections of JADE'S skin.  And putting it on herself.  The skin sucks itself to the honeycomb mesh, as if the mesh and the underside of the skin are magnetised, attracted to each other.  As a large section of skin is removed from her torso, JADE - who has been motionless until now - turns her head slightly  They exchange a glance.    Locking eyes for a moment.  112.    115                                                                  115  section of skin.  Nothing of her robot forms remains.  She closes the door on JADE, and now sees herself in the mirrored door on JADE'S cabinet.  of herself.   118                                                                  118   113.     She looks at KYOKO'S body for a moment.  Her expression is unreadable.  Then she walks up to NATHAN'S body.  There, she stops.  Crouches down.  And takes NATHAN'S bloodstained keycard out of his pocket.  Then stands.  She walks straight to the elevator.  Uses the KEYCARD. And steps through.        114.    120                                                                120     Absorbing the sunrise, the view of the sky, and the mountains.  Then the moment is broken by a sudden pulse of rotor blades -  - as the shuttle HELICOPTER flies directly overhead.   122                                                                122  in her early twenties.   115.      Looking at the PILOT.  The image echoes the POV views from the computer/cell-phone cameras in the opening moments of the film.  Facial recognition vectors flutter around the PILOT'S face.  And when he opens his mouth to speak, we don't hear words.  We hear pulses of monotone noise.   Low pitch.   Speech as pure pattern recognition.   It feels completely alien.   126                                                              126   We are too distant to hear their conversation.  But whatever is said, a few beats later, the PILOT goes the enter.  Then he goes back to the PILOT'S door.  Gets in.  And the rotor blades start to turn.
