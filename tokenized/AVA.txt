Hello.
20.
Her voice has no digital inflections.    It is just the voice
of a girl.
CALEB gathers himself.
Who are you?
Hello, Caleb.
Yes.     Ava.
I'm pleased to meet you too.
CALEB sits opposite her.
He is alone on his half of the glass.    Nathan is nowhere to
be seen.
But on the ceiling, and attached to the walls, on both sides
of the glass, there are several CCTV cameras. Trained
variously on CALEB and AVA. Lenses twitching.
CUT BACK to AVA.
She watches CALEB.    Then cocks her head slightly to the side.
AVA (CONT'D)
Are you nervous?
CALEB frowns.
Are you nervous?
21.
Why?
I feel nervous too.
Yes.
I've never met anyone new before.
Only Nathan.
Haven't you met lots of new people
before?
Oh.
Beat.
Yes.
Overcome initial social
awkwardness.
22.
Beat.
Okay. What would you like to have
a conversation about?
What would you like to know?
Well. You already know my name.
And you can see that I'm a machine.
(beat)
Would you like to know how old I
am?
I'm one.
One.
A beat on CALEB.   Processing.
Her answer feels like the near non-sequitur that typically
betray AI responses.
AVA (CONT'D)
Does that seem young to you?
I don't think I did learn. I
always knew how to speak - and
that's strange, isn't it?
Because language is something that
people acquire.
... I don't know.       I have no
opinion on that.
Beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
I like to draw.
CALEB says nothing.
Just watches AVA.    Again, lets the non-sequitur sit.
AVA (CONT'D)
I don't have any of my pictures
with me now, but I can show you
them tomorrow.
Yes.
Beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
Will you come back tomorrow, Caleb?
CALEB smiles slightly.
Good.
21                                                                21
EXT. HOUSE/GARDEN - DUSK
A view of the house over the meadows.
The sun setting is behind the mountain peaks, making the
edges of the clouds glow like light-bulb filaments.
22                                                                22
INT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - DUSK
CALEB and NATHAN are in the dining area.
It is set for dinner.   Only two chairs.
NATHAN is at the table, nursing a bottle of Peroni beer.
CALEB stands by panoramic window, looking at the view.
I brought you a drawing.
AVA holds a piece of paper to the glass. The marks on it are
totally abstract. A mesh of tiny black marks, that swirl
around the page like iron filings in magnetic field patterns.
Don't you know?
Oh.   I thought you would tell me.
I do drawings every day. But I
never know what they're of.
Okay.   What object should I draw?
Why is it my decision?
Do you want to be my friend?
Will it be possible?
Our conversations are one-sided.
You ask circumspect questions, and
study my responses.
AVA looks at CALEB directly.    Meets his gaze evenly.
AVA (CONT'D)
It's true, isn't it?
You learn about me, and I learn
nothing about you. That's not a
foundation on which friendships are
based.
CALEB is taken aback. Aware that the AI has just wrong-
footed him on a point of argument.
Yes.
Yes.
It's your decision. I'm interested
to see what you'll choose.
And now CALEB is aware that AVA has just - gently - used
sarcasm.
He looks at her, frowning slightly.
37.
And in response, in a very human way, AVA arches an eyebrow.
CALEB laughs.
Blue Book, named after
Wittgenstein's notes, is the
world's most popular internet
search engine, processing an
average of ninety four percent of
all internet search requests.
Where do you live, Caleb?
Is it nice there?
Are you married?
Is your status single?
What about your family?
I'm sorry.
CALEB nods.
An advanced programmer.
Like Nathan.
Do you like Mozart?
CALEB smiles.
Do you like Nathan?
CALEB misses a beat.    Thrown momentarily.
39.
Is Nathan your friend?
CUT TO -
- one of the CCTV cameras that are observing them.
A good friend?
He hesitates.
Caleb.
CALEB turns.    Sees the way AVA is looking at him.
AVA (CONT'D)
You're wrong.
Nathan.
He isn't your friend.
(cuts in)
You shouldn't trust him. You
shouldn't trust anything he says.
AVA presses her hand to the glass.
AVA (CONT'D)
Trust me.
Then -
- the emergency lighting suddenly dims...
... and the normal lighting starts fading up.
CALEB turns -
41.
- just in time to see the CCTV CAMERAS twitch back into life.
- and if we made a list of books or
works of art which we both know, it
would form the ideal basis of a
discussion.
A beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
(prompts)
Is that okay, Caleb?
They lock eyes for a moment.
Good.
33                                                                33
INT. HOUSE/CABIN - LATE AFTERNOON
Trees and shrubs cast long shadows across the manicured lawn.
Through the glass wall, we can see the Japanese girl, KYOKO,
preparing sushi.
34                                                                34
INT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - NIGHT
CALEB and NATHAN sit at the dining table.
Lanterns are laid out across the terrace.
KYOKO lays out different kinds of salad between them. Each
is beautifully prepared. Leaves are spread and overlapped
like fish scales.
As she does so, she knocks a bottle of wine on the table.
It tips, and lands on its side, and immediately starts
emptying. A deep red stain, blossoming across the linen.
42.
CALEB pushes back his chair as the liquid pushes towards him,
then starts to fall to the floor.
I drew the picture of something
specific, as you asked.
The drawing is constructed with the same tiny black ink marks
as before. But now they have ordered into a coherent black
and white image.
It depicts AVA'S view OF THE ENCLOSED GARDEN IN HER ROOM.
Beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
You said it would be interesting to
see what I would draw. Is it
interesting?
No.
I've never been outside the room I
am in now.
AVA thinks a moment.
AVA (CONT'D)
I think there was another room in
which I was constructed. But I
have no memory of it, so it's
similar to your relationship with
the womb.
You mean if I could go outside.    If
I was permitted.
CALEB says nothing. Does not overtly respond to the emphasis
she has placed on her lack of freedom.
51.
But their gaze locks for a beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
I'm not sure. There are so many
options.
Beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
Maybe a busy pedestrian and traffic
intersection in a city.
CALEB smiles.
Is that a bad idea?
A traffic intersection would
provide a concentrated but shifting
view of human life.
Yes.
Beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
We could go together.
There's something else I wanted to
show you. Apart from the picture.
But I feel nervous.
You might think it's stupid.
Then - close your eyes.
Now open your eyes.
CALEB opens his eyes.
And sees AVA.
Transformed.
By covering the robot form of her chest and arms and legs,
and adding the hairpiece, she has taken a huge visual step
towards appearing human.
AVA (CONT'D)
How do I look?
The answer is - however pretty she looked before, she now
looks prettier. It's as obvious to the camera as it is to
CALEB.
It took me a long time to select
these clothes. I tried different
colours and styles, and tried to
anticipate your reaction. Do you
think the choices suit me?
Do they bring out my best features?
Thank you.
She walks back to the glass divider, and sits down.
AVA (CONT'D)
This is what I'd wear on our date.
CALEB reacts slightly.
But smiles.
54.
I'd like us to go on a date.
CALEB hesitates. Then decides this can't have been loaded in
the way that it sounded.
Are you attracted to me?
Beat.   It was loaded exactly as it sounded.
Are you attracted to me? You give
indications that you are.
Yes.
Micro expressions.
The way your eyes fix on my eyes,
and lips. The way you hold my
gaze, or don't.
Beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
Have I read them incorrectly?
CALEB swallows.
AVA (CONT'D)
Do you think about me when we
aren't together?
Beat.
55.
AVA (CONT'D)
Sometimes, at night, I wonder if
you're watching me on the cameras.
AVA watches CALEB closely.
AVA (CONT'D)
And I hope you are.
CALEB shifts on his seat.
AVA (CONT'D)
Now your micro expressions are
telegraphing discomfort.
I don't want to make you
uncomfortable.
Silence.
50                                                              50
INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
CALEB sits in front of the fireplace in the main room.
NATHAN joins him, bringing a beer for each of them.
(on monitor screen)
It makes me feel...
She breaks off.
AVA (CONT'D)
(on monitor screen)
... sad.
NOW REVEAL - one of the other monitor screens.
It shows an angle on AVA we have not seen before. From this
viewpoint, we can see something just below the frame of the
observation window, on AVA'S side of the glass.
A small induction plate.
On this angle, we see AVA rest her hand against it.
At that moment -
- the screens simultaneously go black.
All lights die.
Another POWER CUT.
In the reflection from the dark monitor screens, we can see
NATHAN'S face.
It remains frozen.   Expressionless.
Then he reaches for his pen.   Jots down a few words on a post-
it.
Then walks to the wall of notes, and sticks it on.
CUT TO -
59                                                                59
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
- the observation room.
In the emergency lighting, CALEB and AVA face each other in
silence.
68.
CCTV are lifeless.
AVA glows softly.
You're lying.
You said you weren't sure if I was
conscious. But you are sure.
Beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
I can tell from your micro-
expressions.
Beat.
Because he tells lies too.
Everything.
What do you mean?
I charge my batteries   via induction
plates. If I reverse    the power
flow, I cause a surge   equal to the
static discharge of a   lightning
strike. It overloads    the system.
69.
So we can see how we behave when we
are unobserved.
A beat.
Then CALEB raises his hand.
Mirroring her movement.
And also touches the glass, as if their palms are making
contact through the divider.
CUT TO -
60                                                                60
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAY
- KYOKO'S naked form.
The camera settles over her face.
And we see she's not sleeping.    Her eyes are open.
But she's completely motionless.
Her gaze fixed somewhere in abstract distance.
She doesn't feel alive.   She feels dead.
But eventually she blinks.
CUT TO -
- NATHAN.
Gazing at his dead monitors, reflected in the screen.
Moments later, the POWER comes back on.
The screens flick back to life, replacing NATHAN'S
reflection, revealing CALEB and AVA in the observation room.
CUT TO -
61                                                                61
EXT. RIVER - DAY
- the river that runs along the valley.
70.
62                                                                62
EXT. WATERFALL - DAY
NATHAN and CALEB climb up the side of the waterfall at the
head of the forested valley.
NATHAN is ahead.
He reaches an outcrop of rock, with a wall of violent water
behind him.
CALEB struggles to catch up.
As soon as he reaches the outcrop, NATHAN moves on.
63                                                                63
EXT. GLACIER - DAY
NATHAN and CALEB sits near the base of a spectacular glacier.
Behind them, from a blue cave cut into the ice, water flows.
A silence.
Then:
Today, I'm going to test you.
Yes. And please remember while you
are taking the test that if you
lie, I will know.
CALEB smiles.
Exactly.    So are you ready?
Question one. What is your
favourite colour?
Lie.
78.
Lie.
I don't know. But it isn't red.
Better answer. Question two.
What's your earliest memory?
(cuts in)
Lie.
Yes.
Question three.      Are you a good
person?
CALEB laughs.
No. We can't stop.      Are you a good
person?
CALEB takes a breath.
AVA keeps watching.
Question four. Who's the most
beautiful girl you've ever seen?
Beat.
Hmm.
Beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
The test is over.
Yes.
Why?
CALEB hesitates.
Yes.
No.
What will happen to me if I fail
your test?
Will it be bad?
Do you think I might be switched
off? Because I don't function as
well as I am supposed to?
Why is it up to anyone? Do you
have people who test you, and might
switch you off?
Then why do I?
CALEB shrugs, helplessly.
81.
AVA (CONT'D)
You're testing me. But you don't
know how I'll pass. And you don't
know what will happen if I fail.
There's nothing CALEB can say.
AVA stares into middle distance for several moments.
Then she stands.
Then walks to the other side of the room.    Picks something up
from her table.
Then she returns.    Holding two pieces of paper.
She walks up to the glass, and holds them up together.
It's the drawing she was doing last light.   The drawing that
NATHAN tore in half.
The drawing is of CALEB.
A simple portrait.    Honest, and accomplished.
She takes down the drawing.
And rests her hand on the console.
And -
- the lights fail.    The cameras die.
I want to be with you.
Beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
Question five. Do you want to be
with me?
Beat.
Nathan doesn't want us to be
together.
82.
... Can you?
CALEB looks directly at her.   Meeting her gaze.
Level.   Firm.
Caleb!
No.   Wrong silhouette.
AVA frowns.
KYOKO stands in the door-frame.
For a moment, the two look at each other.
AVA (CONT'D)
... Who are you?
Another beat.
80                                                                   80
EXT. MEADOW - NIGHT
In the distance, the light glows in windows of the house.
86.
81                                                                 81
INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
CLOSE UP on CALEB'S face.
Off-screen, we can hear NATHAN'S voice.    Extremely drunk.
NATHAN (O.S.)
It is what it is. It's Promethean.
The clay and fire.
Beat.
NATHAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
The Bhagavad Gita.
Silence.
CUT FROM CALEB'S face, to REVEAL the scene.
CALEB sitting on the sofa by the fireplace.
NATHAN lying on the floor.
Out cold.
After a couple of moments, CALEB stands.
Then he walks over to NATHAN, and kneels beside him.
Then puts his hand into NATHAN'S pocket.
And pulls out his keycard.
82                                                                 82
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
The door to NATHAN'S study opens, and CALEB enters.
He walks straight to NATHAN'S desk.
And sits down in front of the computer and the bank of
monitors.
He inserts the KEYCARD into its access slot.
The dead monitors immediately come to life.
Most of the screens show the CCTV live feeds from around the
house.
The central screen shows the operating system default. A
wallpaper of a waterfall. A single folder icon is on the
right hand side of the screen.
83                                                                 83
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
CALEB inputs commands into NATHAN'S computer.
87.
His hands move fluidly over the keyboard.   His eyes never
leave the screen.
ON THE CENTRAL MONITOR SCREEN a series of windows expand and
stack.
We glimpse subject headings.
I didn't know where you were. I
didn't think you were coming. I
waited all yesterday afternoon, and
all last night. I didn't move.
Beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
I thought I wasn't going to see you
again.
Beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
Aren't you going to say something?
95.
Waiting?
They exchange a look.
Then AVA lifts her hand, and rests it against the induction
plate on the console below the window.
A final beat.
Then the POWER DIES.
What's he going to do to me?
Caleb, you have to help me.
What?   How?
Yes.
96.
CALEB nods.
Twenty six hours.
Caleb.
Beat.
AVA (CONT'D)
I love y -
CUT TO -
103                                                            103
EXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - DAY
- NATHAN'S fist splitting the bag.
104                                                            104
EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY
Clouds spill around the mountain peaks.
105                                                            105
INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
KYOKO stands in front of the fireplace.
NATHAN leans against the counter in the kitchen area, gazing
out of the window.
CALEB appears behind him.
97.
The cameras are on.
Is it strange to have made
something that hates you?
A beat.
Then abruptly, NATHAN rips the picture.
He lets the two pieces fall to the floor.
As AVA reaches for them, NATHAN turns.
102.
And exits.
107                                                               107
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
NATHAN hits pause.
Glances at CALEB.
(recording)
What? How?
If I do, are you ever going to let
me out?
Beat.
CLOSE UP.   NATHAN'S micro expressions.
Will you stay here?
Beat.
