How long was I out?
4.
Damn. Can't believe I've been
missing this. I was so psyched to
be coming here, I was awake all
night.
JAY smiles.
Yeah.
Long Island. I work on algorithms
for the search engine.
You know what they are?
Is that a good thing?
I guess you know him pretty well.
The pilot laughs.
I won a competition. It was kind
of like a lottery, for employees.
The winner got to spend a week with
him.
Yep.
Believe me. I know it.
CALEB looks out of the window.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Incredible here.
How long until we get to his
estate?
JAY chuckles.
You're leaving me here?
7.
... What building?
The pilot gestures vaguely towards the white water.
... Yes.
... Can we do another?
Hello?
Silence.
Then he is startled a second time, by sudden commencement of
a THUMPING SOUND.
Abrupt.    Rapid.    More or less rhythmic.   From somewhere
nearby.
He exits in the direction of the noise.
13A                                                                  13A
INT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - DAY
CALEB enters a dining area.
Which now reveals...
... a huge glass door.
It presents an arresting view of a garden, river, and the
mountains behind.
10.
The door is open, and through it, we see the reason for the
thumping sound.
Just outside, on a patio, in the sunshine, a man is working a
PUNCH BAG.
14                                                                  14
EXT. GARDEN - DAY
CALEB exits the dining area to an area of neat garden,
looking over the river, and surrounded by the mountain
ranges.
The punch bag is suspended by a chain on an exterior flanking
wall of the house.
The man working it is wearing shorts, and is shirtless.
Bathed in sweat.
His hands are not protected by gloves. Only wraps. Spots of
blood seep through the pale material around his knuckles.
This is NATHAN BATEMAN.   He's thirty.
After a flurry of punches, NATHAN breaks off.
Breathing hard, he wipes at his eyebrows with the back of his
wrist. Sweat droplets cascade down his face.
Then -
- NATHAN senses the other presence.
He turns to see CALEB.    Standing by the open glass wall.
... Hi.
NATHAN starts unravelling his wraps.
No.    Thank you. I'm fine.
Yeah?
NATHAN laughs.
Sure.
Silence, as NATHAN drinks.
CALEB feels he needs to say something.
Looking around, he sees a collection of empty beer bottle on
the kitchen counter.
CALEB (CONT'D)
... Was it a good party?
NATHAN doesn't answer.
He's still drinking.
The silence extends a little.   Verges on odd.
NATHAN puts his empty glass down.
12.
... I am?
Okay.
Beat.
CALEB (CONT'D)
It's good to meet you, Nathan.
CALEB holds out his hand.
NATHAN beams.
... Uh, yes.
You bet.    This is great.
... Sorry?
There's nothing wrong.
15.
No. No way. I wasn't thinking
that. I was thinking: this is
really cool.
... There is?
... What?
NATHAN indicates the desk - where a pen sits next to a
printed document.
19                                                               19
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - DAY
CALEB sits at the desk in his room, holding NATHAN'S pen.
In front of him is a sheet of paper, which reads, at the top:
NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
16.
`The signee agrees to regular data
audit with unlimited access, to
confirm that no disclosure of
information has taken place, in
public or private forums, using any
means of communication, including
but not limited to that which is
disclosed orally or in written or
electronic form...'
CALEB glances back at NATHAN on the bed.
CALEB (CONT'D)
I think I need a lawyer.
It doesn't feel very standard.
... Yeah.    I know what the Turing
Test is.
NATHAN waits.
CALEB (CONT'D)
It's where a human interacts with a
computer. And if the human can't
tell they're interacting with a
computer, the test is passed.
That the computer has artificial
intelligence.
Beat.
CALEB (CONT'D)
... Are you telling me you're
building an AI?
NATHAN shakes his head.
... Holy shit.
If you've created a conscious
machine, it's not the history of
man. It's the history of Gods.
NATHAN smiles.
... Hi.
I'm Caleb.
... Do you have a name?
... I'm pleased to meet you, Ava.
... Why do you ask that?
A beat.
Then AVA repeats her question.
... Yes.   A little.
I'm not sure.
... Do you?
Why do you feel nervous?
... Then we're both in quite a
similar position.
None like you.
So.    Let's break the ice.
He glances at her.   Observing.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Do you know what I mean by that?
What do I mean?
So let's have a conversation. If
we talk, we'll both relax, and get
to know each other at the same
time.
Why don't we start with you telling
me something about yourself.
Whatever comes into your head.
AVA pauses a moment.
Sure.
One what?     One year?   Or one day?
Quite young.
(beat)
When did you learn how to speak?
AVA pauses, as if considering this question for the first
time.
23.
Why?
Some believe language exists in the
brain from birth, and what is
learned is the ability to attach
words and structure to the latent
ability.
Beat.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Would you agree?
That sounds good.       I'd like to see
them.
Yeah.     Definitely.
24.
AVA also smiles.
And suddenly -
- there is a strong sense of something very human there.    In
the way the smile lights up her face.
Sorry. I was just ordering my
thoughts.
She's fascinating. When you talk
to her, you're through the looking
glass.
NATHAN nods.    Approving.
Actually, it's someone else's
quote.
25.
... I don't think that's exactly
what I said.
NATHAN doesn't seem to hear.
But I didn't say that.
Yes.   Although -
NATHAN laughs.
No! No qualification to her. Just
- in the Turing test, the machine
should be hidden from the examiner.
And there's a control, or -
NATHAN waves a hand.
I think you're probably right. Her
language abilities are incredible.
The system is stochastic, right?
NATHAN looks at CALEB blankly.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Non-deterministic.
NATHAN still says nothing.
CALEB presses on.
CALEB (CONT'D)
At first I thought she was mapping
from internal semantic form to
syntactic tree-structure, then
getting linearised words. But then
I started to realise the model was
probabalistic, with statistical
training - or at least some kind of
hybrid.
Silence.
CALEB (CONT'D)
... No?
Try me! I'm hot on high-level
abstraction, and -
... Oh.   Sorry.
I feel...
CALEB pauses.
CALEB (CONT'D)
... that she's fucking amazing.
NATHAN smiles.
Then lifts his bottle.
Cheers.
The glass of the bottles touch.
23                                                                    23
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
God damn it.
He reaches for the remote control.
CLICK.
The TV at the foot of the bed switches on, suddenly lighting
up the room with cold TV glow.
CALEB squeezes his eyes shut, momentarily dazzled by the
brightness.
When his eyes open again, instead of seeing a TV station, he
sees a LIVE FEED from a CCTV camera.
It shows the OBSERVATION ROOM.
CALEB sits upright in bed.
CALEB (CONT'D)
... What the fuck?
AVA is sat at the table.
Drawing.
CUT BETWEEN -
- CALEB watching AVA.
- and varying CCTV ANGLES of AVA as she draws.
The different TV channels flip between feeds from the various
cameras.
CALEB is transfixed by the imagery.
Her posture. Her legs tucked beneath the chair.   The curve
of the breasts on her synthetic torso.
29.
The CCTV images become CALEB'S POV.       The things he is
observing.
CLOSE-UPS of her face.     Her eyes.   Her mouth.
The way she bites her lip in an expression of concentration.
As when she smiled, there is a powerful sense in this tiny
gesture of her feeling sentient and human.
Even more so because her face fills the screen, hiding the
mechanical parts of her form.
Throughout, we never clearly see what AVA is actually
drawing.
END ON -
CALEB.   Glazed.
Then ABRUPTLY -
- the TV goes dead.
And the digital alarm clock goes dead.
And the windowless room is plunged into total darkness, and
total silence. As if the house had been previously filled
with a soft hum of power, which we were unaware of until it
was gone.
In this, we hear CALEB breathing.
... Are you kidding?
He tries his card again.
30.
I don't know. No one really.
What?
I was wondering how the phone
worked. That's all.
... Something happened in my room.
Some kind of power cut. So I came
to see what's going on.
I couldn't open the door to the
bedroom.
Sure.
NATHAN lifts his beer.
... Hi.
The JAPANESE GIRL doesn't answer.
Just turns, and leaves.
31                                                                31
EXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - DAY
In the garden, near the hanging punch bag, there is an
outdoor gym area. A collection of free-weights and exercise
equipment.
NATHAN is lying on an inclined board, with his feet hooked
around a bar, doing sit ups.
CALEB approaches, carrying his coffee.
NATHAN continues to exercise as he talks.
No. It was a good thing.     Thank
you.
You bet.
NATHAN finishes his set, and stands.
I'm not sure. I'm still trying to
figure the examination format.
Testing Ava by conversation is kind
of a closed loop.
(MORE)
34.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Like trying to test a chess
computer by only playing chess.
It depends what you're testing it
for. You can play it to find out
if it makes good moves. But it
won't tell you if it knows it's
playing chess. Or if it even knows
what chess is.
NATHAN starts adding weights to curl dumbbells.
Exactly. And I think being able to
differentiate between those two is
the Turing test you want me to
perform. The difference between an
`AI' and an `I'.
NATHAN laughs.
... What's it a drawing of?
No.
AVA looks disappointed.
Don't you know?
Are you not trying to sketch
something specific? Like an object
or a person.
She shakes her head as she takes the picture down.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Maybe you should try.
Whatever you want.   It's your
decision.
I'm interested to see what you'll
choose.
AVA pauses a moment.
36.
... Of course.
Why wouldn't it be?
... Yes.
... That's a fair comment.
So - you want me to talk about
myself.
Where do you want me to start?
Okay, Ava. Well - you know my
name. I'm twenty four. And I work
at Nathan's company. You know what
his company is?
That's right.
Brookhaven, Long Island.
It's okay. I've got an apartment.
Kind of small. But - it's a five
minute walk to the office. And a
five minute walk to the ocean,
which I like.
No.
... Yeah.
They lock eyes, just for a moment.
Grew up in Portland. No brothers
or sisters. My parents were both
high school teachers.
(MORE)
38.
CALEB (CONT'D)
(beat)
And if we're getting to know each
other, I guess I should say they're
both dead. Car crash when I was
fifteen. In fact I was in the car
with them. Back seat. But it was
the front that got the worst of it.
A long beat.
A kind of processing pause for AVA.
I spent a lot of time in the
hospital. Nearly a year. Got into
coding. By the time I made it to
college, I was pretty advanced.
Yes.
Yes.
CALEB hesitates.   Back-tracks.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Or - kind of. Nathan wrote the
Blue Book base code when he was
thirteen. If you understand code,
what he did was - Mozart or
something.
Beat.
I like Depeche Mode.
Yes.    Of course.
Sure.
Well, a good friend is -
He breaks off.     Feeling the camera, watching.
CALEB (CONT'D)
We only just met. It takes time to
get to know -
AT THAT MOMENT -
- all the power abruptly shuts down, plunging the room into
darkness.
... Wrong about what?
... In what way?
Excuse me?
CALEB frowns.
CALEB (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, Ava, I don't understand
what you're -
... Yes.
AVA smiles.
No.   No problem.
CALEB takes his napkin, and leans down to start wiping the
floor.
Then KYOKO appears beside him.
She holds her hand out for the napkin.
(to Kyoko)
It's okay, don't worry.    I've got
it.
I think she gets that you're
pissed.
43.
Do you know why they happen?
Can't you call them back?
Cheers.
They drink.
You saw how the day went, didn't
you? I mean, I assume you're
watching on the CCTV.
There was one interesting thing
that happened with Ava today.
She made a joke.
It got me thinking. In a way, the
joke is the best indication of AI
I've seen in her. It's discretely
complicated. Kind of non-autistic.
It was a play on words, and a play
on me. She could only do that with
an awareness of her own mind, and
also of awareness of mine.
45.
NATHAN smiles.
Sorry?
Nothing.
No.    Not really.
ON NATHAN'S GLASS - refilling. The view through it, of
CALEB, disappearing in the red liquid.
35                                                               35
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
Ava?
CALEB walks to the connecting corridor, and enters it.
45                                                                45
EXT. GARDEN - BLACK AND WHITE
The door leads CALEB straight out into the gardens.
In black and white, the backdrop of mountains and clouds look
like an Ansel Adams.
A short distance ahead of CALEB, standing on the grass, he
sees AVA.
She locks eyes with him.
Smiles.
He starts to walk towards her.
CUT TO -
46                                                                46
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
- CALEB waking, in his dark bedroom.
Lit by light from his TV.
Where AVA lies on her bed, seeming to be asleep.
CALEB sits up.
Thinking. Perhaps replaying his dream.   Gazing at AVA'S
resting form.
Then reaches for the remote control on the bedside table, and
switches the TV off.
CUT TO -
47                                                                47
EXT. GARDEN - MORNING
Yes.   It is.
She takes the drawing down.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Have you never been outside this
building?
You've never walked outside.
... Where would you go if you did
go outside?
A traffic intersection.
It wasn't what I was expecting.
People watching.
It's a date.
Another beat.    On AVA.    Looking at CALEB.
Then -
Okay.
Why?
52.
I don't think I will.   Whatever it
is.
AVA hesitates.
... Okay.
He closes his eyes.
AVA stands, and walks to the PRIVATE AREA at the back of the
observation room.
As she walks, CALEB reopens his eyes.
Through the semi-opaque dividing glass, he watches her.   The
ghost image.
CUT TO -
- AVA.
In the PRIVATE AREA, she opens a wardrobe space, which
reveals clothes, and a hair-piece.
Then she starts to get dressed.
First a summer dress.
Then stockings.
Then a long-sleeved cardigan.
She checks her reflection in the mirror, and adjusts the
clothes slightly. Making sure that as much of her robot form
is covered as possible.
Then she puts on the hair-piece.     Short, brown hair.
Finally, she makes a subtle adjustment to her face. Similar
to putting on make-up, she adjusts the intensity of her own
skin tones. Her lips redden. Her cheeks blush slightly. A
discreet line of black extends like mascara around her eyes.
CUT TO -
- CALEB.
Watching the ghost shape through the opaque glass.
53.
As she starts to move back towards him, CALEB recloses his
eyes. And keeps them closed, as he hears her approach.
You look... good.
Yes.
... They do.
AVA lights up.
Right. First the traffic
intersection. Then maybe a show.
Yeah.   It would be fun.
What?
... I do?
How?
(echoes)
Micro expressions.
I'm not sure you'd call them micro.
Tell me.
Why did you give her sexuality?   An
AI doesn't need a gender. She
could have been a grey box.
NATHAN sits opposite.
They have sexuality as an
evolutionary reproductive need.
56.
What?
Pleasure response.
That wasn't my real question.
No.     My real question was -
CALEB breaks off.
NATHAN keeps watching. There is a sudden sense that NATHAN
is on the money. On some level, that was CALEB'S real
question.
57.
CALEB (CONT'D)
My real question was: did you give
her sexuality as a diversion
tactic?
NATHAN smiles slightly.
Like a stage magician with a hot
assistant.
Exactly. So. Did you program her
to flirt with me?
Wouldn't it?
NATHAN lets the question hang.
Behind them, KYOKO prepares dinner in the kitchen area.
Of girl?
So did you program her to like me
or not?
NATHAN shrugs.   Insouciant.
Nobody programmed me to be
straight.
This is childish.
Jackson Pollock.
59.
... What?
He never would have made a single
mark.
NATHAN clicks his fingers.
... Hey.
Beat.
I don't know how you did any of
this.
You hacked the world's cell phones?
NATHAN laughs.
This is her hardware?
And the software?
... Blue Book.
NATHAN nods.
Why did you want to show me this?
Remind me of what?
NATHAN gestures at the room around them.
In college, I did a semester on AI
theory.
(MORE)
65.
CALEB (CONT'D)
There was a thought-experiment they
gave us. It's called Mary in the
black and white room.
Beat.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Mary is a scientist, and her
specialist subject is colour. She
she knows everything there is to
know about it. The wavelengths.
The neurological effects. Every
possible property colour can have.
Beat.
CALEB (CONT'D)
But she lives in a black and white
room. She was born there, and
raised there. And she can only
observe the outside world on a
black and white monitor. All her
knowledge of colour is second-hand.
Beat.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Then one day - someone opens the
door. And Mary walks out. And she
sees a blue sky. And at that
moment, she learns something that
all her studies could never tell
her. She learns what it feels like
to see colour. An experience that
can not be taught, or conveyed.
Beat.
CALEB (CONT'D)
The thought experiment was to show
the students the difference between
a computer and a human mind. The
computer is Mary in the black and
white room. The human is when she
walks out.
Beat.
CALEB (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Did you know that I was brought
here to test you?
58                                                                 58
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAY
An interior wall, covered in coloured post-it notes.   At
least hundreds, probably thousands.
66.
At the bottom of the wall, fallen notes have collected like a
miniature yellow snow drift.
AVA (O.S.)
... No.
Reveal the room.
NATHAN'S study. A simple space. One part analogue: the wall
of post-its. One part digital: a desk, in the middle of the
STUDY, with a bank of monitors, and a slot - into which
NATHAN'S KEYCARD is inserted.
On the ceiling is the CIRCULAR WINDOW that CALEB saw when he
first arrived.
Sat at the desk, watching the monitors, is NATHAN.
CALEB (O.S.)
Why did you think I was here?
AVA (O.S.)
I didn't know. I didn't question
it. I was... pleased. To meet
you. And then...
Beside the desk, there is a daybed.
On it, KYOKO lies.     Naked.   Apparently sleeping.
CALEB (O.S.)
I'm here to test if you have a
consciousness, or if you're just
simulating one.
Beat.
CALEB (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Nathan isn't sure if you have one
or not.
Reveal the monitor screens on the desk.
Some show live feeds from CALEB'S BEDROOM and BATHROOM, and
AVA'S PRIVATE ROOM.
AVA (O.S.)
What about you? Do you think I
have a consciousness?
Long beat.
CALEB (O.S.)
I'm not sure either.
NATHAN is watching the feed from the OBSERVATION ROOM.
67.
Where AVA and CALEB are sat, either side of the dividing
glass. Having the conversation we have been hearing.
We pick up the conversation from NATHAN'S distanced and
voyeuristic POV. Locked-off CCTV. Voices played through
speakers.
CALEB (CONT'D)
(on monitor screen)
How does that make you feel?
What about?
Why did you tell me that I
shouldn't trust Nathan?
Lies about what?
Including the power cuts?
Don't you think it's possible that
he's watching us right now? That
the blackouts are orchestrated, so
he can see how we behave when we
think we're unobserved.
AVA lifts her hand to reveal a disc on her left palm.
... You're causing the cuts?
AVA raises her right hand.
She touches it against the glass.
Can we talk about the lies you've
been spinning me?
NATHAN glances over at CALEB.
I didn't win a competition. And
there was no lottery to meet you.
I was selected.
NATHAN waits.
CALEB (CONT'D)
It's obvious, once I stop to think.
Why would you randomly select an
examiner for a Turing test? You
could have had some bean-counter
turn up at your front door. Or the
guy who fixes the air conditioning.
Beat.
Why me?
Proof of what?
Kyoko.
KYOKO turns at the sound of her name, but doesn't respond.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Kyoko - where's Nathan?
She doesn't answer.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Jesus! You really don't speak a
word of English?
CALEB walks over to her, and takes hold of her wrist.
74.
CALEB (CONT'D)
I said: where's Nathan?
KYOKO looks at CALEB.
Then, in answer to his question, she reaches up to the top
button of her shirt and pops it open.
CALEB releases her wrist at once.
CALEB (CONT'D)
What the fuck?
She undoes the next button, and pulls open the shirt,
revealing her bare chest.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Stop!
... I don't want to.
(to himself)
I don't fucking believe this.
NATHAN makes his way to CALEB, and rests a hand on his
shoulder.
What were you doing with Ava?
NATHAN smiles back at NATHAN, smiling, alcohol-glazed.
You tore up her picture.
It's because you're drunk.
Test me?
Right. Those pesky micro-
expressions.
Shoot.
Red.
What?
... Then what is my favourite
colour?
All right.     Hold on a minute...
CALEB thinks for a moment.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Okay. I get it. I guess seeing as
I'm not six, I don't really have a
favourite colour.
AVA nods.
Well, it's actually a memory of
kindergarten. There was this kid
who -
... Really?
Okay.    Wait.
CALEB concentrates.
CALEB (CONT'D)
So, there is a kind of an earlier
memory. But it's ultra vague.
It's like... a sound. And, maybe
sky. Or blue. No, I think sky.
And I think the sound is my
mother's voice.
AVA nods.
79.
Oh, man. Can we stop the test?
You're a walking lie detector, and
I've suddenly realised this is a
fucking minefield.
Yes. I think so.      I'm a good
person.
CALEB waits.
AVA smiles slightly.
You are.
Beat.
Did I pass?
That's a relief.
AVA reacts.
80.
Why is it a relief?
Oh, you know...
Just, if there's a test, I guess by
definition you want to pass.
Beat.
Ava -
... I don't know.
... Ava, I don't know the answer to
your question. It's not up to me.
No.    I don't.
Yes.     I do.
I know.
Beat.    Then:
CALEB (CONT'D)
So ask me one more question.
(beat)
Ask me if I can out smart him.
Yeah.   I can.
76                                                              76
INT. HOUSE/CONCRETE STAIRS - DAY
Why did you make Ava?
Maybe. I don't know. But I'm
asking why you did it.
NATHAN shrugs.
The next model?
... I didn't know there was going
to be a model after Ava.
I knew there must have been
prototypes. So, not the first.
But - I thought maybe the last.
NATHAN shakes his head.
So - when you make a new model,
what you do with the old one?
What did you do with Kyoko?
84.
Sure.
Beat.
I am become death, the destroyer of
worlds.
No: there you go again. It's not
my quote. It's what Oppenheimer
said when he made the atomic bomb.
I think I'm starting to get why all
this fucks with your head.
Hey. In the meantime, I'd say
we're about due a refill.
79                                                                   79
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
AVA sits alone.
Watching the door on the other side of the glass, waiting for
it to open.
It remains closed.
Beats pass.
Then -
- unexpectedly, it opens.      Revealing a silhouette figure.
AVA reacts instinctively.
What's the problem, Nathan?
It's right here.
96                                                               96
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
CALEB enters his bedroom.
Shuts the door.
AVA is on the TV.    Sat alone in the observation room.
CALEB looks at her.
She looks at him.
He switches the TV off.
Lies on the bed.    On his back.
Stares at the ceiling.
CUT TO -
FLASHCUT IMAGES.
Of KYOKO removing her skin.
CUT BACK TO -
- CALEB.
97                                                               97
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
CALEB enters the bathroom.
He goes to the sink.
He looks at his own reflection.
Deep into his own eyes.
Opens his mouth.    Looks inside.
Feels his wrist for his pulse.
Feels his skin on the same seam where KYOKO opened herself.
Pauses.
Then picks up his disposable plastic razor.
And breaks it.
Forcing it with his hand against the porcelain of the sink.
Snapping the plastic.
93.
Popping out the tiny razor blade.
A beat.
Then he picks up the blade between his thumb and forefinger.
Places it against his forearm.
And cuts.
Blood runs out.
CALEB watches it.
Sees the way droplets hit the white sink. The way they
expand, and merge with existing water droplets.
Then he switches the tap on, and puts his arm under the flow.
The water clears away the blood, revealing the cut.
CALEB pulls open at the slice with his fingers, spreading it.
Revealing no carbon fibre.   Only muscle.
He exhales.
And glances up at the mirror, and his own reflection.
Then...
... reaches up his forearm, and very deliberately wipes blood
across the glass.
98                                                                98
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
On the monitors in NATHAN'S study, the live feed of CALEB'S
bathroom is partially obscured as CALEB smears the two-way
mirror.
Then, through the blood, we see him pull his fist back.
And punch the glass.
As it shatters, the feed goes dead.
Only now REVEAL -
- that the person watching the monitor is KYOKO.
Her expression is unreadable.
Through the glass of the indoor garden, NATHAN lies on the
sheets, crashed out.
94.
99                                                                99
EXT. GARDEN - DAY
Sunlight on the grass.
In the background, we can hear the rhythmic pounding of
NATHAN'S punch bag.
100                                                              100
EXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - DAY
NATHAN is in a frenzy.
Sweat pouring.
Obliterating the bag.
101                                                              101
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - DAY
I'm waiting.
Don't talk. Just listen. You were
right about Nathan. Everything you
said.
He's going to reprogram your AI.
Which is the same as killing you.
I'm going to. We're getting out of
here tonight.
I get Nathan blind drunk. Then I
take his keycard, and reprogram all
the security protocols in this
place. When he wakes, he's locked
inside, and we've walked out of
here. I only need you to do one
thing. At ten o'clock tonight,
trigger a power failure. Can you
do that?
How long does your battery charge
last?
So we'll have about a day to get to
a cell-phone or kitchen store.
Somewhere we can buy an induction
plate. After that...
CALEB breaks off.
CALEB (CONT'D)
... we'll work it out. Together.
Silence.
Then the POWER RETURNS.
The lights come back.
AVA and CALEB stare at each other.
Hey.
No.
Has it been a whole week?
NATHAN smiles.
After they've signed their NDAs.
NATHAN laughs.
I appreciate that. And - let me
say: thank you for bringing me
here. It's been a trip.
You know what?
CALEB walks over to the kitchen area, and pulls two beers
from the fridge.
CALEB (CONT'D)
We need to drink to that.
98.
CALEB walks back to NATHAN.     Extends a hand.   Holding a
Peroni.
But NATHAN doesn't take it.
You don't want a beer?
NATHAN shrugs.
... Maybe wine or something.
Are you kidding?      I'm drinking
alone?
Cheers, then.
Right.
Beat.
Her AI is beyond doubt.
Yes.
Pretending.
100.
Why would she do that?
I don't think it's me whose head is
fucked.
You're a bastard.
What are you talking about?
(recording)
We're getting out of here tonight.
(recording)
I get Nathan blind drunk. Then I
take his keycard, and reprogram the
all security protocols in this
place. When he wakes, he's locked
inside, and we've walked out of
here. I only need you to do one
thing. Trigger a power failure at
ten o'clock tonight.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Turn it off.
What was the real test?
So my only function was to be
someone she could use to escape.
And you didn't select me because I
was good at coding.
NATHAN hesitates.
You selected me by my search engine
inputs.
With no family.
And no girlfriend.
CALEB stares into the brightness above him.
CALEB (CONT'D)
Did you design her face based on my
pornography profile?
Did you?
Beat.
To change the lockdown procedure.
So that in the event of a power
cut, instead of sealing, the doors
all opened.
Well, we'll find out.
NATHAN frowns.
I figured you were probably
watching us during the power cuts.
Beat.
CALEB (CONT'D)
So I already did all those things.
When I got you drunk yesterday.
NATHAN freezes.
... Okay.
AVA leaves, closing the door behind her.
CUT TO -
- the monitors.
The CCTV feed of AVA walking down the connecting corridor to
NATHAN'S BEDROOM.
114                                                               114
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
AVA stands in NATHAN'S BEDROOM, in front of the previous AI
androids.
She is unclothed.
She gazes at the androids.
Then she removes the arm from JADE, and replaces her own
shattered limb.
She takes a moment to see how the new limb looks in the
mirrors.
Then she starts removing sections of JADE'S skin.
And putting it on herself.
The skin sucks itself to the honeycomb mesh, as if the mesh
and the underside of the skin are magnetised, attracted to
each other.
As a large section of skin is removed from her torso, JADE -
who has been motionless until now - turns her head slightly
to look at AVA.
They exchange a glance.    Locking eyes for a moment.
112.
115                                                                  115
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
Transfixed, CALEB watches AVA'S metamorphosis.
First through the glassed-off garden that separates Nathan's
study from his bedroom. Then, when he can't get a clear view
through the foliage, on the monitors.
116                                                                  116
EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN
First light breaks over the mountains.
117                                                                  117
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - DAWN
The glow of honeycomb mesh vanishes as AVA applies the last
section of skin.
Nothing of her robot forms remains.
She closes the door on JADE, and now sees herself in the
mirrored door on JADE'S cabinet.
AVA sees a naked human girl.      And is hypnotised by the sight
of herself.
118                                                                  118
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAWN
CALEB watches as AVA - now clothed - walks back down the
connecting corridor to the study...
... then passes straight by his door.
Ava?
CALEB gets up.
Goes to the closed door.       Tries to open it.
There is a red LED light by the keycard plate.     Locked.
He swipes his card, with his photo ID.
The red light remains.
CALEB (CONT'D)
(calls out)
Ava!
He runs back to the monitors.
On them, AVA has reached the GLASS CORRIDOR.
113.
118A                                                                118A
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAWN
AVA stands in the glass corridor.
She looks at KYOKO'S body for a moment.
Her expression is unreadable.
Then she walks up to NATHAN'S body.
There, she stops.
Crouches down.
And takes NATHAN'S bloodstained keycard out of his pocket.
Then stands.
She walks straight to the elevator.
Uses the KEYCARD.
And steps through.
118AA                                                              118AA
INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - DAWN
AVA walks up the glass staircase from the main room.
118B                                                                118B
EXT. ENTRANCE - DAWN
AVA steps outside for the first time.   Into the garden.
118C                                                                118C
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAWN
CALEB sticks his card into the slot by NATHAN'S computer.
Instantly, THE EMERGENCY LIGHTING COMES UP and all the
screens die. Replaced by a single word.
No, no, no -
119                                                                  119
EXT. GARDEN - DAWN
From the garden, we can see CALEB through the glass of the
circular window, shouting Ava's name.
On our side of the glass, there is silence.
AVA walks away.
114.
120                                                                120
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAWN
CALEB looks up at the thick glass of the circular window,
several metres above him.
Far out of reach.
He starts to shout.
Ava!   AVA!
120A                                                              120A
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAWN
NATHAN'S body.
KYOKO'S body.
121                                                                121
EXT. RIVER - DAWN
AVA stops.
Absorbing the sunrise, the view of the sky, and the
mountains.
Then the moment is broken by a sudden pulse of rotor blades -
- as the shuttle HELICOPTER flies directly overhead.
122                                                                122
EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY
The helicopter sweeps over the glacier, into the valley.
123                                                                123
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
