Dialogue:
He types fast, with two fingers.   monitor.    Twenty four. Glazed. Ear buds in, connected to cell phone. Head bobbing slightly to the music.  As we watch from the monitor POV, we can see the computer's facial recognition system in operation.  2.    faces of all the people behind him.    He gazes at the message.  Then clicks on the link. Then mouths the word: Fuck.    text.  features, and reacting to shifts in his expression.   text.    3.    yes  A beat later, a stream of text messages start appearing:  Buena estoria bro  omfg fucking AWESOME  :o)  take me take me?!?  Caleb > [infinity symbol]   are reacting.  One stands and applauds. and embraces him from behind planting a kiss on his cheek.   He still has his headphones in. Still in the audio bubble, which, despite the commotion around him, remains unburst.    - to find himself in the front seat of a helicopter.  The pilot, JAY, is a man in his forties.  Outside the window is the mountain landscape.    How long was I out?  4.     bearings.    Damn. Can't believe I've been missing this. I was so psyched to be coming here, I was awake all night.  JAY smiles.    Yeah.    Long Island. I work on algorithms for the search engine.    You know what they are?    Is that a good thing?    I guess you know him pretty well.  The pilot laughs.      I won a competition. It was kind of like a lottery, for employees. The winner got to spend a week with him.    Yep.    Believe me. I know it.     Incredible here.    How long until we get to his estate?  JAY chuckles.   banks, turns, and descends.   8                                                                    8   outside.  JAY goes to the side of the helicopter, pops open a hatch,  no man-made structures to be seen.     You're leaving me here?  7.      ... What building?  The pilot gestures vaguely towards the white water.     Moments later, in a roar of wind and noise, the helicopter is lifting off.  Equally suddenly, the noise is fading, and the helicopter is soaring upwards, and banking back towards the glacier.  Then it is gone.    Bird song and wind rush replace engine noise.    10                                                                 10  awkwardly bumping his wheeled suitcase over the ground.  The banks of the river start to climb, to an intimidating drop.  It feels that this can't be the right way.   No signal at all.  He puts his phone back in his pocket.   11                                                                 11   Ahead, almost hidden in trees, there is a steel and glass structure.  8.    12                                                                12   In the ground, in a grassy clearing, he finds a circular window, reflecting the sky.  He walks up to the window, and looks inside.  It reveals what is effectively a glass-covered well - about four metres deep, with smooth concrete sides.  At the bottom of the well is a brightly-lit room, which appears to be an office of some sort. There is a desk, with monitors, and a chair.  But apparently no one inside.  camouflaged by forest - the dark shapes and straight lines of a low, one storey building complex.    As he nears the entrance -  an unknown source.    Near what seems to be the front door, a pillar protrudes from the ground. Head-height. With a GLASS SCREEN on one side.  Below the screen is a DISPENSER.    ... Yes.   eyes with his own reflection, the screen FLASHES. A single bright strobe.  Almost immediately afterwards, something small clatters into the DISPENSER.    On it, there is an embedded chip, and a photograph of his face. He looks comically surprised.    ... Can we do another?    Beside the door, a KEYCARD PLATE is set into the wall, with a    13                                                                    13  welcomed, or noticed.  But he is not.    Hello?  Silence.  Then he is startled a second time, by sudden commencement of a THUMPING SOUND.  Abrupt.    Rapid.    More or less rhythmic.   From somewhere nearby.  He exits in the direction of the noise.    Which now reveals...  ... a huge glass door.  It presents an arresting view of a garden, river, and the mountains behind.  10.    The door is open, and through it, we see the reason for the thumping sound.  Just outside, on a patio, in the sunshine, a man is working a  looking over the river, and surrounded by the mountain ranges.  The punch bag is suspended by a chain on an exterior flanking wall of the house.  The man working it is wearing shorts, and is shirtless. Bathed in sweat.  His hands are not protected by gloves. Only wraps. Spots of blood seep through the pale material around his knuckles. This is NATHAN BATEMAN.   He's thirty.  After a flurry of punches, NATHAN breaks off.  Breathing hard, he wipes at his eyebrows with the back of his wrist. Sweat droplets cascade down his face.  Then -  - NATHAN senses the other presence.     ... Hi.  NATHAN starts unravelling his wraps.   is a jug of non-specific vegetable juice waiting, and a glass.  11.        No.    Thank you. I'm fine.    Yeah?  NATHAN laughs.    Sure.  Silence, as NATHAN drinks.   Looking around, he sees a collection of empty beer bottle on the kitchen counter.    ... Was it a good party?  NATHAN doesn't answer.  He's still drinking.  The silence extends a little.   Verges on odd.  NATHAN puts his empty glass down.  12.          ... I am?      Okay.  Beat.    It's good to meet you, Nathan.   NATHAN beams.   blood on his fingers.  He discretely wipes it on his trousers.   16                                                                 16   It has no buttons.   Only a keycard plate.  NATHAN swipes his card.    The floor is polished concrete. The walls and ceiling are glass, behind which diffused light glows.  At regular intervals, glass doors are set, glowing with the same light, flush with the walls.  Beside the closed doors are keycard plates and soft red LEDs.    ... Uh, yes.    Then swipes the card on the plate.  The LED turns blue.         You bet.    This is great.    ... Sorry?    There's nothing wrong.  15.      No. No way. I wasn't thinking that. I was thinking: this is really cool.    ... There is?    ... What?  NATHAN indicates the desk - where a pen sits next to a printed document.   19                                                               19     In front of him is a sheet of paper, which reads, at the top:    `The signee agrees to regular data audit with unlimited access, to confirm that no disclosure of information has taken place, in public or private forums, using any means of communication, including but not limited to that which is disclosed orally or in written or electronic form...'     I think I need a lawyer.    It doesn't feel very standard.   Looks at the paper.  Then hesitates a final moment -  - and signs.  When he looks round, NATHAN has moved from the bed, and is standing directly behind him.   implied.    ... Yeah.    I know what the Turing Test is.  NATHAN waits.    It's where a human interacts with a computer. And if the human can't tell they're interacting with a computer, the test is passed.    That the computer has artificial intelligence.  Beat.    ... Are you telling me you're building an AI?  NATHAN shakes his head.    ... Holy shit.    If you've created a conscious machine, it's not the history of man. It's the history of Gods.  NATHAN smiles.    A beat -   Then -  her chair.  Then she sits down.  And speaks.      ... Hi.    I'm Caleb.    ... Do you have a name?    ... I'm pleased to meet you, Ava.    He is alone on his half of the glass.    Nathan is nowhere to be seen.  But on the ceiling, and attached to the walls, on both sides of the glass, there are several CCTV cameras. Trained       ... Why do you ask that?  A beat.   ... Yes.   A little.    I'm not sure.    ... Do you?    Why do you feel nervous?    ... Then we're both in quite a similar position.    None like you.    So.    Let's break the ice.  He glances at her.   Observing.    Do you know what I mean by that?    What do I mean?    So let's have a conversation. If we talk, we'll both relax, and get to know each other at the same time.    Why don't we start with you telling me something about yourself.    Whatever comes into your head.  Sure.    One what?     One year?   Or one day?    Her answer feels like the near non-sequitur that typically betray AI responses.    Quite young. When did you learn how to speak?   Why?    Some believe language exists in the brain from birth, and what is learned is the ability to attach words and structure to the latent ability.  Beat.    Would you agree?     That sounds good.       I'd like to see them.      Yeah.     Definitely.  24.    It is set for dinner.   Only two chairs.  NATHAN is at the table, nursing a bottle of Peroni beer.       Sorry. I was just ordering my thoughts.    She's fascinating. When you talk to her, you're through the looking glass.  NATHAN nods.    Approving.    Actually, it's someone else's quote.  25.      ... I don't think that's exactly what I said.  NATHAN doesn't seem to hear.    But I didn't say that.   Yes.   Although -  NATHAN laughs.    No! No qualification to her. Just - in the Turing test, the machine should be hidden from the examiner. And there's a control, or -  NATHAN waves a hand.    I think you're probably right. Her language abilities are incredible. The system is stochastic, right?     Non-deterministic.  NATHAN still says nothing.     At first I thought she was mapping from internal semantic form to syntactic tree-structure, then getting linearised words. But then I started to realise the model was probabalistic, with statistical training - or at least some kind of hybrid.  Silence.    ... No?    Try me! I'm hot on high-level abstraction, and -    ... Oh.   Sorry.    27.      I feel...     ... that she's fucking amazing.  NATHAN smiles.  Then lifts his bottle.     Cheers.  The glass of the bottles touch.   23                                                                    23       sink.  REVEAL several long scars on his back.  Neat. Unusual.      Long-healed.   But from serious wounds, or surgery.   25                                                                    25       Darkness.  The clock reads 01:32 am.  The soft glow from the digital readout throws a light on the remote control.  28.       Eyes closed.    For a beat.  Then his eyes open.   He's wide awake.  He turns over in the bed.  Then turns back again.   to 2:29 am.    God damn it.  He reaches for the remote control.  brightness.  When his eyes open again, instead of seeing a TV station, he sees a LIVE FEED from a CCTV camera.  It shows the OBSERVATION ROOM.     ... What the fuck?    Her posture. Her legs tucked beneath the chair.   The curve of the breasts on her synthetic torso.  29.    observing.  CLOSE-UPS of her face.     Her eyes.   Her mouth.  The way she bites her lip in an expression of concentration. As when she smiled, there is a powerful sense in this tiny gesture of her feeling sentient and human.  Even more so because her face fills the screen, hiding the mechanical parts of her form.   Then ABRUPTLY -  - the TV goes dead. And the digital alarm clock goes dead.  And the windowless room is plunged into total darkness, and total silence. As if the house had been previously filled with a soft hum of power, which we were unaware of until it was gone.     Then gets out of bed.  Goes to his bedroom door.  Beside the keycard plate, the LED is red.  He swipes it with his card.  The LED stays red.    ... Are you kidding?  He tries his card again.  30.      Which suddenly has the quality of a prison cell.  Beats pass.  Then -  - as abruptly as the power went off, it comes back again.  The emergency lighting goes off, the TV and digital alarm clock turn back on.   Then he tries his card again.  This time, the LED turns blue, and the door opens.    Revealing the GLASS CORRIDOR outside.   27                                                               27    Ahead, one of the doors off the corridor is ajar.   28                                                               28   It appears to be empty.    Still and silent.   Low lit.  Only one area is properly illuminated: a wall, on which a large JACKSON POLLOCK drip painting hangs.  looping colour for a moment.  A TELEPHONE, on a low table.  as if sensing he is doing something that - obscurely - he shouldn't.  Then he picks up the handset.  It's dead.  31.    He hits some buttons.  It stays dead.  There is a slot by the phone.  Pulls out his KEYCARD. Puts it in the slot...  ... and a light on the handset glows red.    NATHAN is lying on a sofa. A bottle of Peroni rests on his stomach. On the carpet beside him are a couple of empties.      I don't know. No one really.    What?    I was wondering how the phone worked. That's all.    ... Something happened in my room. Some kind of power cut. So I came to see what's going on.    I couldn't open the door to the bedroom.    Sure.  NATHAN lifts his beer.      The door to his room has been opened.  Outside is the bright glass corridor.   33.    She looks Japanese. She's stunningly pretty.     And she doesn't say anything.  Just walks in, carrying a tray with a cafetiere, which she    ... Hi.  The JAPANESE GIRL doesn't answer.  Just turns, and leaves.   31                                                                31   NATHAN continues to exercise as he talks.    No. It was a good thing.     Thank you.      You bet.  NATHAN finishes his set, and stands.    I'm not sure. I'm still trying to figure the examination format. Testing Ava by conversation is kind of a closed loop.   Like trying to test a chess computer by only playing chess.    It depends what you're testing it for. You can play it to find out if it makes good moves. But it won't tell you if it knows it's playing chess. Or if it even knows what chess is.  NATHAN starts adding weights to curl dumbbells.    Exactly. And I think being able to differentiate between those two is the Turing test you want me to perform. The difference between an `AI' and an `I'.  NATHAN laughs.       observation room.    ... What's it a drawing of?    No.   Don't you know?    Are you not trying to sketch something specific? Like an object or a person.  She shakes her head as she takes the picture down.    Maybe you should try.    Whatever you want.   It's your decision.    I'm interested to see what you'll choose.   ... Of course.    Why wouldn't it be?      ... Yes.   footed him on a point of argument.    ... That's a fair comment.    So - you want me to talk about myself.    Where do you want me to start?   sarcasm.  He looks at her, frowning slightly.  37.       Okay, Ava. Well - you know my name. I'm twenty four. And I work at Nathan's company. You know what his company is?    That's right.    Brookhaven, Long Island.    It's okay. I've got an apartment. Kind of small. But - it's a five minute walk to the office. And a five minute walk to the ocean, which I like.    No.    ... Yeah.  They lock eyes, just for a moment.    Grew up in Portland. No brothers or sisters. My parents were both high school teachers.   And if we're getting to know each other, I guess I should say they're both dead. Car crash when I was fifteen. In fact I was in the car with them. Back seat. But it was the front that got the worst of it.  A long beat.     I spent a lot of time in the hospital. Nearly a year. Got into coding. By the time I made it to college, I was pretty advanced.   Yes.    Yes.     Or - kind of. Nathan wrote the Blue Book base code when he was thirteen. If you understand code, what he did was - Mozart or something.  Beat.      I like Depeche Mode.    39.      Yes.    Of course.    Sure.    Well, a good friend is -  He breaks off.     Feeling the camera, watching.   We only just met. It takes time to get to know -    panel LED glows red.    The vague quality of blankness in her eyes is completely gone.      ... Wrong about what?   ... In what way?    Excuse me?     I'm sorry, Ava, I don't understand what you're -    41.    - just in time to see the CCTV CAMERAS twitch back into life.   previous posture, facial expression, and manner.  conversation they have been having.    ... Yes.   Lanterns are laid out across the terrace.  KYOKO lays out different kinds of salad between them. Each is beautifully prepared. Leaves are spread and overlapped like fish scales.  As she does so, she knocks a bottle of wine on the table.  It tips, and lands on its side, and immediately starts emptying. A deep red stain, blossoming across the linen.  42.    then starts to fall to the floor.    No.   No problem.  floor.  Then KYOKO appears beside him.  She holds her hand out for the napkin.    It's okay, don't worry.    I've got it.    KYOKO kneels and starts to wipe the wine off the floor.       I think she gets that you're pissed.  43.     his own.    Do you know why they happen?    Can't you call them back?    NATHAN drains his glass.  Then refills.   44.      Cheers.  They drink.    Then answers.   Casual.    You saw how the day went, didn't you? I mean, I assume you're watching on the CCTV.   There was one interesting thing that happened with Ava today.    She made a joke.    It got me thinking. In a way, the joke is the best indication of AI I've seen in her. It's discretely complicated. Kind of non-autistic.    It was a play on words, and a play on me. She could only do that with an awareness of her own mind, and also of awareness of mine.  45.    NATHAN smiles.        Sorry?    NATHAN waits.    Nothing.      No.    Not really.  ON NATHAN'S GLASS - refilling. The view through it, of   35                                                               35        He leans forwards into the mirror, as if checking to make sure he shaved properly on his cheek.  46.    And he hears the noise again.   The servo, making a tiny corrective movement.   Then he deliberately steps sideways, and turns his head. Ostensibly to check the other cheek. But actually to have shifted his position.  And he hears the noise again.  Very faint.   But definitely there.  A micro beat.   Not giving any outward indication that he has just figured out that there is a camera behind the bathroom mirror.   37                                                                37    room.  To the full-length mirror on the wall.  The high vent for the air-conditioning system.  The TV itself.   Then pulls on a T-Shirt.   Picks up his ID card.   And exits.    47.    Systematically trying his ID CARD on the doors he passes.  He tries one.  Then another.    Then another.   Then another.  Every single door remains locked.   39                                                                39  garden.  It is virtually the only room apart from his own that he seems able to gain access to.  The lights are all off. The room is only lit by the moonlight through the sliding glass wall, and lanterns in the garden.  He starts walking towards the glass wall. Then stops.  On the patio, NATHAN is working the punch bag.  KYOKO stands a few feet away from him, holding a white towel.  With the glass wall closed, no noise of the impacts penetrates into the room.   NATHAN'S attack on the bag seems strange. More extreme than the hard workout we saw the first time he was using the bag.  This seems brutal.   Almost frenzied.  For a few moments, the attack on the bag is observed in silence, from inside the main room.     Coloured strips of ribbon are visible through the split in the bag.  NATHAN stands, catching his breath.  Then he reaches out a hand.  KYOKO hands him the towel.  NATHAN wipes his face.  Then reaches out again, this time catching KYOKO'S arm. He pulls her towards him, and starts to kiss her.  Reaching under her shirt.  Pulling her skirt up over her thighs.   42                                                                42     After a beat, the lights in the corridor fade out.   43                                                                43   REVEAL he is in the observation room.   Ava?    45                                                                45   In black and white, the backdrop of mountains and clouds look like an Ansel Adams.     Lit by light from his TV.    50.     Yes.   It is. She takes the drawing down.    Have you never been outside this building?    You've never walked outside.    ... Where would you go if you did go outside?   she has placed on her lack of freedom.  51.    But their gaze locks for a beat.      A traffic intersection.    It wasn't what I was expecting.   People watching.    It's a date.   Then -    Okay.    Why?  52.      I don't think I will.   Whatever it is.   ... Okay.  He closes his eyes.  Through the semi-opaque dividing glass, he watches her.   The ghost image.     Watching the ghost shape through the opaque glass.  53.    eyes. And keeps them closed, as he hears her approach.      You look... good.    Yes.    ... They do.   But smiles.  54.      Right. First the traffic intersection. Then maybe a show.   the way that it sounded.    Yeah.   It would be fun.    What?    ... I do?    How?    Micro expressions.          I'm not sure you'd call them micro.    NATHAN joins him, bringing a beer for each of them.    Tell me.    Why did you give her sexuality?   An AI doesn't need a gender. She could have been a grey box.  NATHAN sits opposite.    They have sexuality as an evolutionary reproductive need.  56.      What?    Pleasure response.      That wasn't my real question.    No.     My real question was -   NATHAN keeps watching. There is a sudden sense that NATHAN question.  57.      My real question was: did you give her sexuality as a diversion tactic?  NATHAN smiles slightly.    Like a stage magician with a hot assistant.    Exactly. So. Did you program her to flirt with me?   Wouldn't it?  NATHAN lets the question hang.  Behind them, KYOKO prepares dinner in the kitchen area.    Of girl?   about to make.    So did you program her to like me or not?  NATHAN shrugs.   Insouciant.    Nobody programmed me to be straight.    This is childish.        Jackson Pollock.  59.      ... What?      He never would have made a single mark.  NATHAN clicks his fingers.          In his bedroom.   - to find NATHAN in the glass corridor.  Waiting for him.    ... Hey.  Beat.   future tech.  Along the left-hand wall are sections of android bodies - limbs, torsos, hands - lined in cabinets.  On the opposite wall are a collection of heads. Skull-forms, some with complex carbon-fibre and pneumatic muscle structures, ready to frown or smile, without their synthetic flesh covering.  The synthetic faces are separate. Hanging on armatures, like hats on hat-stands, waiting to be worn.  In the middle of the room is a kind of operating table.  62.        I don't know how you did any of this.   You hacked the world's cell phones?  NATHAN laughs.      This is her hardware?    And the software?   ... Blue Book.  NATHAN nods.   liquid.  It looks like deep space, filled with star fields.    Then hands him the orb back.  64.      Why did you want to show me this?      Remind me of what?  NATHAN gestures at the room around them.    We watch him.   And stay on him.    In college, I did a semester on AI theory.   There was a thought-experiment they gave us. It's called Mary in the black and white room.  Beat.    Mary is a scientist, and her specialist subject is colour. She she knows everything there is to know about it. The wavelengths. The neurological effects. Every possible property colour can have.  Beat.    But she lives in a black and white room. She was born there, and raised there. And she can only observe the outside world on a black and white monitor. All her knowledge of colour is second-hand.  Beat.    Then one day - someone opens the door. And Mary walks out. And she sees a blue sky. And at that moment, she learns something that all her studies could never tell her. She learns what it feels like to see colour. An experience that can not be taught, or conveyed.  Beat.    The thought experiment was to show the students the difference between a computer and a human mind. The computer is Mary in the black and white room. The human is when she walks out.  Beat.    Did you know that I was brought here to test you?   58                                                                 58  first arrived.  Sat at the desk, watching the monitors, is NATHAN.    Why did you think I was here?    I'm here to test if you have a consciousness, or if you're just simulating one.  Beat.    Nathan isn't sure if you have one or not.  Reveal the monitor screens on the desk.    I'm not sure either.  NATHAN is watching the feed from the OBSERVATION ROOM.  67.    glass. Having the conversation we have been hearing.  We pick up the conversation from NATHAN'S distanced and voyeuristic POV. Locked-off CCTV. Voices played through speakers.    How does that make you feel?   silence.  68.    CCTV are lifeless.   What about?    Why did you tell me that I shouldn't trust Nathan?    Lies about what?    Including the power cuts?    Don't you think it's possible that he's watching us right now? That the blackouts are orchestrated, so he can see how we behave when we think we're unobserved.   ... You're causing the cuts?   Mirroring her movement.  And also touches the glass, as if their palms are making contact through the divider.     head of the forested valley.  NATHAN is ahead.  He reaches an outcrop of rock, with a wall of violent water behind him.   As soon as he reaches the outcrop, NATHAN moves on.   63                                                                63   Behind them, from a blue cave cut into the ice, water flows.  A silence. Then:    Can we talk about the lies you've been spinning me?     I didn't win a competition. And there was no lottery to meet you. I was selected.  NATHAN waits.    It's obvious, once I stop to think. Why would you randomly select an examiner for a Turing test? You could have had some bean-counter turn up at your front door. Or the guy who fixes the air conditioning.  Beat.    NATHAN shrugs.  71.      Why me?    Proof of what?    The glow from the CIRCULAR WINDOW to NATHAN'S STUDY is like a full moon on the grass.  72.     Looks down the light-well to NATHAN'S STUDY.  Where he sees NATHAN and KYOKO.  They are having sex.       He shuts his eyes.   contacting.    He exhales.  Then switches off the taps.   66                                                                66     The TV plays the live stream from the observation room.    73.     And freezes.    Seeing the television.  On the screen, NATHAN reaches down to the table.    68                                                                 68   Standing by the painting, he can see KYOKO.    Kyoko.  KYOKO turns at the sound of her name, but doesn't respond.    Kyoko - where's Nathan?  She doesn't answer.    Jesus! You really don't speak a word of English?   74.      I said: where's Nathan?   Then, in answer to his question, she reaches up to the top button of her shirt and pops it open.     What the fuck?  She undoes the next button, and pulls open the shirt, revealing her bare chest.    Stop!    NATHAN has entered.  He's holding a drink.   His words are slurred.   happened.  KYOKO starts walking to the center of the room.  75.    And once taken position, she starts dancing.     ... I don't want to.    I don't fucking believe this.  shoulder.      What were you doing with Ava?  NATHAN smiles back at NATHAN, smiling, alcohol-glazed.    You tore up her picture.   together.  Although NATHAN is drunk, they work through the beats of a routine they have obviously done many times before.  It's just starting to look weirdly impressive -  76.    - when NATHAN totally loses his balance.  On his way down, he lands hard on a glass coffee table.  Looking up at him, the glass frosts.   69                                                                69    70                                                                70  - and uses it to swipe the brass plate.  The LED turns blue.    It's because you're drunk.   his pocket.    They walk past a semi-circle line of long cabinets, which line the wall opposite the bed.  They are like a row of slender wardrobes, each with a mirrored door.  Once he's reached the bed, NATHAN tips towards it. It's almost as if he's asleep before he even hits the sheets.  77.      73                                                                73        reflections.    Test me?      Right. Those pesky micro- expressions.    Shoot.    Red.    What?    ... Then what is my favourite colour?    All right.     Hold on a minute...     Okay. I get it. I guess seeing as I'm not six, I don't really have a favourite colour.  Well, it's actually a memory of kindergarten. There was this kid who -    ... Really?    Okay.    Wait.     So, there is a kind of an earlier memory. But it's ultra vague. It's like... a sound. And, maybe sky. Or blue. No, I think sky. And I think the sound is my mother's voice.     Oh, man. Can we stop the test? You're a walking lie detector, and I've suddenly realised this is a fucking minefield.     Yes. I think so.      I'm a good person.    You are.  Beat.    Did I pass?    That's a relief.     Why is it a relief?    Oh, you know...    Just, if there's a test, I guess by definition you want to pass.  Beat.   Ava -    ... I don't know.    ... Ava, I don't know the answer to your question. It's not up to me.    No.    I don't.    81.      A simple portrait.    Honest, and accomplished.  She takes down the drawing.  And rests her hand on the console.  And -  - the lights fail.    The cameras die.    Then -    Yes.     I do.    I know.  Beat.    Then:    So ask me one more question. Ask me if I can out smart him.    Level.   Firm.    Yeah.   I can.   76                                                              76  watching the water cloud.     Why did you make Ava?    Maybe. I don't know. But I'm asking why you did it.  NATHAN shrugs.      The next model?    ... I didn't know there was going to be a model after Ava.    I knew there must have been prototypes. So, not the first. But - I thought maybe the last.  NATHAN shakes his head.    So - when you make a new model, what you do with the old one?      What did you do with Kyoko?  84.        Sure.  Beat.        I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.    No: there you go again. It's not my quote. It's what Oppenheimer said when he made the atomic bomb.    I think I'm starting to get why all this fucks with your head.      Hey. In the meantime, I'd say we're about due a refill.   79                                                                   79   Off-screen, we can hear NATHAN'S voice.    Extremely drunk.     NATHAN lying on the floor. Out cold.   Then he walks over to NATHAN, and kneels beside him.  Then puts his hand into NATHAN'S pocket.  And pulls out his keycard.   82                                                                 82   He walks straight to NATHAN'S desk.  And sits down in front of the computer and the bank of monitors.  He inserts the KEYCARD into its access slot.  The dead monitors immediately come to life.  Most of the screens show the CCTV live feeds from around the house.  The central screen shows the operating system default. A wallpaper of a waterfall. A single folder icon is on the right hand side of the screen.   83                                                                 83   87.    His hands move fluidly over the keyboard.   His eyes never leave the screen.  ON THE CENTRAL MONITOR SCREEN a series of windows expand and stack.  We glimpse subject headings.     84                                                                84  from the slot -  - when something makes him hesitate.  His eyes have gone to the folder icon on the right hand side of the screen.  It is titled DEUS EX MACHINA.   He double-clicks the folder.  It expands into a window, which contains a long list of sub- folders.  Each sub-folder is named after a girl.   LILY'S folder expands into a window, stacked with thumbnail images of a girl.         KYOKO is lying on NATHAN'S bed.  She's naked.    On her back.   Legs open.   But apart from that, she doesn't react.  the bed.  He hesitates.  Then pulls the first door open.  LILY is inside. Standing upright.     Gazing back at him, frozen, blank eyed.   He sees a slender black girl, whose limbs are robotic, but whose torso and head are synthetic.  He opens another door, and another, and another.  Then steps back, into the middle of the room, and gazes at the line of android girls.  90.    Stunned.  The camera drifts away from him.  Then settles.  In the multiple reflections of the open mirror doors, we can see KYOKO'S naked and sexually receptive form on the bed behind him.  Like an infinity reflection in a hall of mirrors.   91                                                                 91  He reaches out a hand.  She takes it.  He gently pulls her to a standing position.  Then he moves her arms away from her body...  ... and sees, running under her arms in a straight contour, over her ribs, there is a faint line.  He touches it with his finger.  KYOKO steps back.  But it's not a defensive action.    It's just to give her space...  ... as she reaches under her arm, and adjusts something unseen. And a moment later, the faint line that runs down each side of her torso is opening. As if unzipping.  Then KYOKO puts a hand either side of her torso, and pulls off the skin covering over her entire chest, in a single section from her collar bone, over the breasts, to her solar plexus.  Revealing underneath the honeycomb mesh and her robot form.   93                                                                 93  is on the live CCTV feed.  Making his way along the mezzanine.  91.       Transfixed, as KYOKO now reaches around the back of her head.  And finds something on the back of her head, at the nape of her neck, inside her hairline.  Which unzips the skin around her jaw.  Allowing her to remove her face.   95                                                                 95     What's the problem, Nathan?   picks something up from the floor.  92.      It's right here.   96                                                               96     Shuts the door.   She looks at him.  He switches the TV off.  Lies on the bed.    On his back.  Stares at the ceiling.     97                                                               97     He goes to the sink.  He looks at his own reflection.  Deep into his own eyes.  Opens his mouth.    Looks inside.  Feels his wrist for his pulse.  Feels his skin on the same seam where KYOKO opened herself.  Pauses.  Then picks up his disposable plastic razor.  And breaks it.  Forcing it with his hand against the porcelain of the sink.  Snapping the plastic.  93.    Popping out the tiny razor blade.  A beat.  Then he picks up the blade between his thumb and forefinger.  Places it against his forearm.  And cuts.  Blood runs out.   Sees the way droplets hit the white sink. The way they expand, and merge with existing water droplets.  Then he switches the tap on, and puts his arm under the flow.  The water clears away the blood, revealing the cut.  Revealing no carbon fibre.   Only muscle.  He exhales.  And glances up at the mirror, and his own reflection.  Then...  ... reaches up his forearm, and very deliberately wipes blood across the glass.   98                                                                98  mirror.  Then, through the blood, we see him pull his fist back.  And punch the glass.  As it shatters, the feed goes dead.  Only now REVEAL -  - that the person watching the monitor is KYOKO.  Her expression is unreadable.  Through the glass of the indoor garden, NATHAN lies on the sheets, crashed out.  94.    99                                                                99      Enters.  He sits opposite her, on the other side of the dividing glass.   I'm waiting.   slightly.   Don't talk. Just listen. You were right about Nathan. Everything you said.    He's going to reprogram your AI. Which is the same as killing you.    I'm going to. We're getting out of here tonight.    I get Nathan blind drunk. Then I take his keycard, and reprogram all the security protocols in this place. When he wakes, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here. I only need you to do one thing. At ten o'clock tonight, trigger a power failure. Can you do that?      How long does your battery charge last?    So we'll have about a day to get to a cell-phone or kitchen store. Somewhere we can buy an induction plate. After that...     ... we'll work it out. Together.  Silence. Then the POWER RETURNS.  The lights come back.     97.      Hey.    No.      Has it been a whole week?  NATHAN smiles.     After they've signed their NDAs.  NATHAN laughs.    I appreciate that. And - let me say: thank you for bringing me here. It's been a trip.    You know what?  from the fridge.    We need to drink to that.  98.    Peroni.  But NATHAN doesn't take it.    You don't want a beer?  NATHAN shrugs.    ... Maybe wine or something.  tightly.    Are you kidding?      I'm drinking alone?    Then raises his own.    Cheers, then.    NATHAN watches.  99.      Collecting himself slightly.   Trying to think how to get his plan back on track.    Right.  Beat.    Her AI is beyond doubt.    Yes.   him.    Pretending.  100.      Why would she do that?        Silence.    I don't think it's me whose head is fucked.    You're a bastard.      On it, a clip of film is playing.       What are you talking about?    Then turns.  He walks towards a chair.    And sits down.  103.    As he does so, NATHAN has started to play another clip.     We're getting out of here tonight.    I get Nathan blind drunk. Then I take his keycard, and reprogram the all security protocols in this place. When he wakes, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here. I only need you to do one thing. Trigger a power failure at ten o'clock tonight.   Turn it off.      What was the real test?    104.    Directly above, he sees a spot-light in the ceiling.  It dazzles him.    So my only function was to be someone she could use to escape.    And you didn't select me because I was good at coding.  NATHAN hesitates.    You selected me by my search engine inputs.    With no family.    And no girlfriend.     Did you design her face based on my pornography profile?    Did you?  Beat.          To change the lockdown procedure. So that in the event of a power cut, instead of sealing, the doors all opened.    Well, we'll find out.  NATHAN frowns.      I figured you were probably watching us during the power cuts.  Beat.    So I already did all those things. When I got you drunk yesterday.  NATHAN freezes.    Almost as an afterthought, NATHAN lands a deceptive, fast   NATHAN helps him down to the floor.  A couple of yards away is one of his curl dumbbells.  He walks over.  Picks the dumbbell up.  Spins off the weights.    Leaving him with a thick metal bar.  Then exits.   111                                                               111  CCTV feed.   NATHAN'S monitors.  Then -  Down the glass corridor. Through the threshold to NATHAN'S private quarters.  Then -      ... Okay.   First through the glassed-off garden that separates Nathan's study from his bedroom. Then, when he can't get a clear view through the foliage, on the monitors.   116                                                                  116  connecting corridor to the study...  ... then passes straight by his door.    Ava?   Goes to the closed door.       Tries to open it.  There is a red LED light by the keycard plate.     Locked.  He swipes his card, with his photo ID.  The red light remains.    Ava!  He runs back to the monitors.   Instantly, THE EMERGENCY LIGHTING COMES UP and all the screens die. Replaced by a single word.    No, no, no -   119                                                                  119  circular window, shouting Ava's name.  On our side of the glass, there is silence.  several metres above him.  Far out of reach.  He starts to shout.
