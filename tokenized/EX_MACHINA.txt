INT. OFFICE - DAY
- a COMPUTER MONITOR.
Lines of code appear, as they are typed.

putchar(a); putchar (b);putchar (c); putchar('!'*n');
}

CUT TO -
- a view above an ultra-cool, ultra-designed open-plan
office.
In a kitchen area, young men and women mill and chat.
Casually dressed. Feels like an intelligent, relaxed
environment.
Behind them, more young men and women sit at desks, in front
of screens and keyboard.
Each workstation is personalised. Photographs of friends or
family, or pets. Cutting from magazines. Ironic
superhero/video-game figurines.
CUT TO -
- the hands of the young man writing code.   This is CALEB.
He types fast, with two fingers.
CUT TO -
- EXTREME CLOSE UP of a pinhole web-cam lens in CALEB'S
monitor.
CUT TO -
- the POV of the web-cam.
Looking back at CALEB.
Twenty four. Glazed. Ear buds in, connected to cell phone.
Head bobbing slightly to the music.
As we watch from the monitor POV, we can see the computer's
facial recognition system in operation.
2.
Imaged as vector boxes, which track CALEB'S face, and the
faces of all the people behind him.
CUT TO -
- the COMPUTER MONITOR.
On which a message appears, in a small window, over the code.
VIP EMAIL RECEIVED
subject: HIDDEN
CUT TO -
- the monitor web-cam POV.
As CALEB stops typing.
He gazes at the message.
Then clicks on the link.
Then mouths the word: Fuck.
CALEB reaches for his cell phone.
CUT TO -
- the CELL PHONE POV, seen from the tiny camera above the
screen, as CALEB lifts the phone, and starts keying-in a
text.
We see facial recognition software flickering over CALEB'S
features, and reacting to shifts in his expression.
CUT TO -
- the cell phone. The screen.   The tiny camera nestled above
it. Lens glinting.
On the screen, a time-bar extends next to the word:
sending
A beat later, a reply text message appears.
WTF?   seriously!?
CUT TO -
- the WEB CAM POV, watching CALEB react to the arrival of the
text.
CUT TO -
- cell phone screen.
CALEB sends the word:
3.
yes
A beat later, a stream of text messages start appearing:
Buena estoria bro
omfg fucking AWESOME
:o)
take me take me?!?
Caleb > [infinity symbol]
CUT TO -
- the computer monitor POV.
Behind CALEB, a few of the people behind CALEB in the office
are reacting.
One stands and applauds.
A GIRL comes out from behind her desk, runs over to CALEB,
and embraces him from behind planting a kiss on his cheek.
CALEB still looks dazed.
He still has his headphones in. Still in the audio bubble,
which, despite the commotion around him, remains unburst.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY
A spectacular mountain landscape. Waterfalls drop down
massive rock faces to inland lakes. Rivers push through
forest. Forest spreads across valley floors, which rise to
snow peaks.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
CALEB wakes abruptly -
- to find himself in the front seat of a helicopter.
The pilot, JAY, is a man in his forties.
Outside the window is the mountain landscape.
