Caleb.
NATHAN beams.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Caleb Smith.
Dude. I've been so looking forward
to this.
15                                                                  15
INT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - DAY
NATHAN walks past CALEB, and goes to a bar area, where there
is a jug of non-specific vegetable juice waiting, and a
glass.
11.
Come in, come in.
CALEB puts his bag down.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
You want something to eat or drink
after your journey?
You sure?
NATHAN pours himself a glass of the vegetable juice.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
I'd been thinking we'd have
breakfast together, but to be
honest, I can't eat anything right
now. I gotta tell you - I woke up
this morning with the mother of all
fucking hangovers.
Like you wouldn't believe. And if
I have a heavy night, I always try
to compensate the next morning.
Exercise. Juice. Anti-oxidants.
You know?
Party?
NATHAN looks at CALEB.   His expression is unreadable.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Caleb. I'm going to put this out
there so it's said.
CALEB waits.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
You're freaked out.
Yeah. You're freaked out by the
house, and the mountains, because
it's all so super-cool. And you're
freaked out by me. To be meeting
me. In this room, having this
conversation, at this moment.
Right?
CALEB doesn't have time to answer.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
And I get that. The moment you're
having.
NATHAN smiles.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
But dude, can we get it behind us?
Can we just be two guys? Nathan
and Caleb. Not the whole employer-
employee thing.
It's good to meet you too, Caleb.
They shake.
13.
When CALEB takes his hand back, there is a little smear of
blood on his fingers.
He discretely wipes it on his trousers.
16                                                                 16
EXT. HOUSE/ELEVATOR - DAY
NATHAN and CALEB enter an elevator.
It has no buttons.   Only a keycard plate.
NATHAN swipes his card.
Down.
The elevator starts to move.
16A                                                            16A
EXT. RIVER - DAY
Water flows over rocks.
17                                                                 17
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
CALEB and NATHAN exit the elevator, into a glass corridor.
The floor is polished concrete. The walls and ceiling are
glass, behind which diffused light glows.
At regular intervals, glass doors are set, glowing with the
same light, flush with the walls.
Beside the closed doors are keycard plates and soft red LEDs.
CALEB carries his bag, looking slightly encumbered next to
NATHAN.
So I guess the first thing I should
do is explain your pass. It's
simple enough. It opens some
doors, but it doesn't open others.
And that just makes everything easy
for you, right?
Because you're like: oh fuck, I'm
in someone else's house, can I do
this, can I do that? And this card
takes all that worry away. If you
try to open a door and it stays
shut: okay, it's off limits.
(MORE)
14.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
If you try another door, and it
opens: it's for you.
NATHAN stops by a door.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Let's try this one.
CALEB hunts around in his pockets for his keycard.
Then swipes the card on the plate.
The LED turns blue.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Guess it's for you, Caleb.
18                                                                  18
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - DAY
NATHAN follows CALEB into a bedroom.
You like?
It has the vibe of a mid-level business hotel.      Bed, table,
TV.
Except it has no windows.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
It's your room. You got yourself a
bed, cupboards, a little desk, and
a bathroom through there. A little
fridge.
NATHAN opens the fridge.       Inside it is full of bottled water.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Cosy, right?
CALEB puts his bags down.
What?
There's something wrong.       What is
it?
It's the windows. You're thinking:
there's no windows. And it's not
cosy. It's claustrophobic.
Caleb. There's a reason the room
has no windows.
Uh-huh. In many ways, this
building isn't a house. It's a
research facility. Buried in these
walls are enough fibre optic cables
to reach the Moon and lasso it.
NATHAN sits on the bed.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
And I want to talk to you about
what I'm researching. I want to
share it with you. In fact, I want
to share it with you so much, it's
eating me up inside.
Beat.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
But there's something I need you to
do for me first.
It's standard.
Okay, it's not standard.
NATHAN shrugs.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
What can I tell you? You don't
have to sign. We could spend the
next seven days shooting pool and
getting drunk together. Bonding.
And when you discover what you
missed out on, in a year or so's
time, you'll spend the rest of your
life regretting it.
CALEB turns back to the desk.
Looks at the paper.
Then hesitates a final moment -
- and signs.
When he looks round, NATHAN has moved from the bed, and is
standing directly behind him.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Good call.
NATHAN takes the piece of paper.
Folds it.   Puts it in his pocket.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
So.
17.
Beat.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Do you know what the Turing Test
is?
CALEB reacts - immediately knowing what NATHAN has just
implied.
And what does a pass tell us?
I've already built one.
NATHAN stands.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
And over the next few days, you're
going to be the human component in
a Turing Test.
That's right, Caleb. You got it.
Because if that test is passed, you
are dead center of the single
greatest scientific event in the
history of man.
18.
I like you.
CUT TO -
20                                                                20
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
- what appears to be a neon coloured jellyfish. Tendrils
like axons, hanging in a black-blue liquid space.
REVEAL -
- the jellyfish is contained in a glass orb.
Which is held in an exposed cavity at the back of machined
skull-shape...
... which is part of a robot girl.
Her name is AVA.
She's an extraordinary piece of engineering.
Proportioned as a slender female in her twenties, her limbs
and torso are a mixture of metal and plastic and carbon
fibre.
The carbon fibre is charcoal colour. The plastic is cream.
The metal has the yellow-warmth of nickel.
The shapes of her body approximate the form of muscle.   There
are biceps, and breasts. Her hands have five delicate
digits.
Her body-structure is covered in a delicate skin. The skin
is a mesh, in the pattern of a honeycomb. Like a spiderweb,
it is almost invisible unless side-lit.
The one part of her that is not obviously an inorganic
construct is her face - which is that of a strikingly
beautiful girl. Created in a defined oval, from the top of
the forehead to just below her chin. Indistinguishable from
a real girl in its appearance and in the way it moves -
except for one thing.
There is a very slight, almost imperceptible blankness in her
eyes.
19.
As we observe AVA, she fits a section of skull-plate to the
back of her head, which obscures the glass orb and jellyfish
structure.
Then -
- she half turns. As if having become aware of another
presence in the room.
REVEAL -
- the room in which AVA stands.
AVA'S living area is made up of three primary spaces.
The main area is the OBSERVATION ROOM. A large area,
arranged around a glass box, from which she can be viewed.
At the back of the observation room, behind a sheet of semi-
opaque glass, is the PRIVATE AREA. This contains a bed-like
structure, a desk, a wardrobe, and a mirror.
And behind the private area is the GARDEN AREA. This is a
small decorative indoor garden, lit by lamps. The garden is
sealed off from AVA by a thick wall of glass.
There are also several oval discs positioned around the room,
made of some kind of dark non-reflective material. These are
induction plates.
And there is a chair, which faces the glass observation box.
And facing that chair, inside the observation box, is another
chair.
Beside which, CALEB stands.
A beat -
- as CALEB and AVA see each other for the first time.
Then -
- AVA starts walking. Revealing a secondary impact of her
engineering: how she moves. The unconscious precision of her
steps. The fluidity of her action.
CALEB is transfixed as she covers the length of the room to
her chair.
Then she sits down.
And speaks.
So?
CALEB turns.
Don't order. Just speak.
`Through the looking glass'.
You've got a way with words there,
Caleb. You're quotable.
You know I wrote it down. That
other line you came up with. About
how if I've created a conscious
machine, I'm not man. I'm God.
I just thought - fuck. That's so
perfect. It's so good for the
story, when we get to tell it. `I
turned to Caleb, and he was looking
back at me. And he said: you're
not a man, you're a God'.
Whatever it was you said.    I wrote
it down.
As a kind of punctuation mark, NATHAN downs the remains of
his beer. Then stands, and gets another from the bar.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
So anyway. First impressions:
you're impressed.
`Although'? There's a
qualification to you being
impressed?
I think we're past that. If I hid
Ava from you, so you just heard her
voice, she would pass for human.
(MORE)
26.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
The real test is to show you she is
a robot. Then see if you still
feel she has consciousness.
Caleb. I understand you want me to
explain how Ava works. But - I'm
sorry. I don't think I'll be able
to do that.
(cuts in)
It's not because you're too dumb.
It's because I want to have a beer
and a conversation with you. Not a
seminar.
It's cool.
NATHAN studies at CALEB for a beat.
27.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Just answer me this. What do you
feel about her? Nothing
analytical. Just - how do you
feel?
Dude.   Cheers.
CALEB lifts his bottle too.
Sorry, dude.
CALEB startles.   Turns.
NATHAN is lying on a sofa. A bottle of Peroni rests on his
stomach. On the carpet beside him are a couple of empties.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
You don't have clearance to use the
phone.
NATHAN'S voice is very slightly slurred.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
You understand. Given Ava. And
you being kind of an unknown. I
mean - a great guy, and so on.
Instant pals. But...
CALEB puts the handset back in its cradle.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Who did you want to call?
Ghostbusters.
Who'd ya want to call?
Ghostbusters. You don't remember
that? It's a good movie. A ghost
gives Dan Ackroyd oral sex.
Uh huh.
32.
Beat.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
What are you doing awake at this
time, anyway? Did you come to join
the party?
Ah. The power cuts. Yeah, we've
been getting them recently. I'm,
uh... working on it.
It's a security measure. Automatic
lockdown. Otherwise anyone could
open the place up just by disabling
the juice.
NATHAN smiles.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
If it happens again, relax.   Okay?
Sweet dreams.
29                                                             29
EXT. MOUNTAINS - NIGHT
Above the mountains, dense star constellations wheel in the
clear sky.
30                                                             30
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - MORNING
CALEB is woken by light flooding on to his face.
The door to his room has been opened.
Outside is the bright glass corridor.
CALEB sits up to see a GIRL entering his room.
33.
She looks Japanese. She's stunningly pretty.     And she
doesn't say anything.
Just walks in, carrying a tray with a cafetiere, which she
puts on CALEB'S bedside table.
Hey. Sorry to send Kyoko to wake
you, man. I just didn't want too
much of the day to slip by.
She's some alarm clock, huh?   Gets
you right up in the morning.
CALEB smiles.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
So.   Day two. You set?
So what's the plan today?    Hit me.
How else would you test a chess
computer?
So it's simulation versus actual.
`An AI and an I'. Beautiful. I'm
going to start following you around
with a fucking dictaphone.
NATHAN glances over at CALEB.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
In the meantime, do me a favour.
Ease up a little on the text-book
approach. All I want is simple
answers to simple questions. Last
night, I asked how you feel about
her. And you gave me a great
answer.
NATHAN starts doing curls.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Now the question is: how does she
feel about you?
A beat.    On CALEB.
CUT TO -
35.
32                                                                32
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
- CALEB and AVA facing each other through the glass of the
observation room.
Shit, Kyoko. Are you serious?
(to Caleb)
Did it get you?
Give her the cloth.
Dude - you're wasting your time.
She can't speak a word of English.
Her hand remains outstretched.
CALEB hesitates.   Then hands her the napkin.
KYOKO kneels and starts to wipe the wine off the floor.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
It's like a firewall against leaks.
Means I can talk trade secrets over
dinner with an HOD or CEO, and know
it will go no further. Right,
Kyoko?
She looks up at her name.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
But it also means I can't tell her
I'm pissed when she's so fucking
clumsy that she pours wine over my
house guest.
KYOKO goes back to cleaning around CALEB'S feet.
CALEB looks visibly uncomfortable.
Good. Because I am pissed.     Hey.
Kyoko.
KYOKO looks over again.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Go-go.
She stands, and leaves.
NATHAN walks to over the bar, where he picks up another
bottle.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
It's funny. It doesn't matter how
rich you are: shit goes wrong. You
can't insulate yourself from it.
It's supposed to be death and taxes
you can't avoid. But actually it's
death and shit.
NATHAN walks back to the table.    Fills CALEB'S glass.   Then
his own.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
It's like these power cuts. You
would not believe how much I spent
on the generator system here. But
I'm getting failures every day.
No. The system was supposed to be
bullet proof, but the guys who
installed it obviously fucked
something up.
There's too much classified stuff
here. So after the job was done, I
had them all killed.
CALEB shoots a glance at NATHAN.    Confirms: just joking.
NATHAN drains his glass.
Then refills.
CALEB'S glass is still untouched.
44.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Anyway.   Here's to your second day.
Cheers.
So how did it go?    What have you
got to report?
CALEB hesitates.
Then answers.   Casual.
Sure.    But I want to hear your
take.
Beat.
... Yeah?
Right. When she threw your line
back at you. About being
interested to see what she'd
choose. I noticed that too.
What do you mean?
Yeah. She's aware of you, all
right.
NATHAN drinks.   Watching CALEB.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
And what about the power cut?
CALEB freezes up.    Subtly.
The power cut. That was the only
bit I couldn't see. All the
cameras fail, I lose audio, the
works.
Beat.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
So what happened?
CALEB takes a sip of his wine.
NATHAN waits.
Nothing?    She didn't remark on it
at all?
CALEB puts the glass down.     And meets NATHAN'S gaze.
Sure.
Actually, I'm not sure that's true.
Can you think of an example of
consciousness, at any level, human
or animal, that exists without a
sexual dimension?
Maybe. Maybe not. What imperative
does a grey box have to interact
with another grey box? Does
consciousness exist without
interaction?
NATHAN takes a drink of his beer.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Anyway, sexuality is fun. If
you're going to exist, why not
enjoy it? You want to remove the
chance to fall in love and fuck?
He leans forward, conspiratorially.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
And, yes. In answer to your real
question: you bet she can fuck. I
made her anatomically complete.
She has a cavity between her legs,
with a concentration of sensors.
Engage with them in the right way,
and she'll get a pleasure response.
She'll come. So if you want to
screw her, mechanically speaking,
you can. And she'd enjoy it.
CALEB swallows.
No?
I don't follow.
Ah. So: a hot robot, who clouds
your ability to judge her AI.
Because if I had, would that be
cheating.
What's your type, Caleb?
No, of salad dressing. Yes, of
girl. In fact, don't even answer.
Let's say it's black chicks.
NATHAN brushes away whatever protestation CALEB might be
about to make.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
For the sake of argument, that's
your thing. So - why is it your
thing? Because you did a detailed
study of all racial types, and
cross-referenced the study with a
points-based system? No. You just
are attracted to black chicks.
(MORE)
58.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
A consequence of accumulated
external stimulus, that you
probably didn't even register as
they registered with you.
I programmed her to be
heterosexual. Just like you were
programmed to be heterosexual.
But you are attracted to her.
No, this is adult. And by the way,
you decided to be straight?
Please. Of course you were
programmed. By nature or nurture,
or both.
NATHAN stands.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
To be honest, Caleb, you're kind of
annoying me now. This is your
insecurity talking, not your
intellect.
CALEB opens his mouth to reply, but NATHAN shuts him down.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Come with me.
50A                                                            50A
INT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - DAY
NATHAN and CALEB stand in front of the Pollock drip painting.
You know this guy, right?
Jackson Pollock. The drip painter.
He let his mind go blank, and his
hand go where it wanted. Not
deliberate, not random. Someplace
in between. They called it
automatic art.
NATHAN gazes at the canvas.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Let's make this like Star Trek,
okay? Engage intellect.
I'm Kirk. Your head is the warp
drive. `Engage intellect'. What
if Pollock had reversed the
challenge? Instead of trying to
make art without thinking, he said:
I can't paint anything unless I
know exactly why I'm doing it.
What would have happened?
CALEB thinks.
See? There's my guy. There's my
buddy, who actually thinks before
he opens his mouth. He'd never
have made a single mark. The
challenge is not to act
automatically. It's to find an
action that is not automatic. From
talking, to breathing, to painting.
NATHAN glances back at CALEB.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
To fucking. Even falling in love.
A beat.
NATHAN kills his beer.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
For the record, Ava is not acting
as if she likes you.
(MORE)
60.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
And her flirting isn't an algorithm
to fake you out. You're the first
man she's ever seen who isn't me.
And I'm like her dad, right? So
can you blame her for getting a
crush on you?
NATHAN glazes a moment.    Then comes back.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
No.    You can't.
51                                                             51
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
In her room, AVA stands in front of the mirror.
She is wearing the summer dress she put on earlier.
Checking her reflection from different angles.
Subtly girlish.    Unself-conscious.
Then -
- she starts to take the dress off.
Throughout the narrative, we have almost only ever seen AVA
in an unclothed form. But now - having been clothed - the
undressing seems to make her naked.
And the act itself feels charged. Sexualised, in the way the
clothing is unbuttoned, and dropped, and her shape is
revealed.
Finally, once she is completely undressed -
- AVA turns.     And glances.
Straight at the camera.
CUT TO -
52                                                             52
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
- CALEB.
In his bedroom.
Watching AVA, at this exact angle.
CUT TO -
53                                                             53
EXT. RIVER - DAY
- the river.
61.
On the bank, a little distance from the house, there is a
dead animal. Its species is indistinct. It's little more
than a bundle of matted brown hair.
Its lower half lies in the water.
The quick moving river has stripped the bones of flesh, skin,
and fur.
REVEAL KYOKO in the background.   Watching the river.
54                                                               54
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAY
CALEB exits his room -
- to find NATHAN in the glass corridor.
Waiting for him.
Hey.
I want to show you something cool.
55                                                               55
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAY
NATHAN swipes his card against a plate.
The LED turns blue.
56                                                               56
INT. HOUSE/CONSTRUCTION LAB - DAY
NATHAN leads CALEB into a laboratory, filled with android
future tech.
Along the left-hand wall are sections of android bodies -
limbs, torsos, hands - lined in cabinets.
On the opposite wall are a collection of heads. Skull-forms,
some with complex carbon-fibre and pneumatic muscle
structures, ready to frown or smile, without their synthetic
flesh covering.
The synthetic faces are separate. Hanging on armatures, like
hats on hat-stands, waiting to be worn.
In the middle of the room is a kind of operating table.
62.
So this is the virtual womb that
Ava was talking about. Where she
was constructed.
CALEB is stunned by the sight.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Come in.   Take a look.
NATHAN walks over to the synthetic faces, and picks one of
them up.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
If you knew the trouble I had
getting an AI to read and duplicate
facial expressions... Know how I
cracked it?
Almost every cell phone has a
microphone, a camera, and a means
to transmit data. So I switched on
all the mikes and cameras, across
the entire fucking planet, and
redirected the data through Blue
Book. Boom. A limitless resource
of facial and vocal interaction.
And all the manufacturers knew I
was doing it. But they couldn't
accuse me without admitting they
were also doing it themselves.
NATHAN puts the face back on its armature.
NATHAN moves to one of the skull forms.
He moves the curved top plate, revealing the skull cavity.
Inside is an ellipse orb, the approximate volume of a brain,
filled with what looks to be blue liquid. Suspended in the
liquid is the neon jellyfish we glimpsed previously in AVA.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Here we have her mind. Structured
gel.
63.
The axon-like tendrils glitter and flicker with tiny pulses
of light.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Had to get away from circuitry.
Needed something that could arrange
and rearrange on a molecular level,
but keep its form where required.
Holding for memories. Shifting for
thoughts.
NATHAN removes the orb, and hands it to CALEB.
Wetware.
Surely you can guess.
It was the weird thing about search
engines. They were like striking
oil in a world that hadn't invented
internal combustion. They gave too
much raw material. No one knew
what to do with it.
CALEB looks at the orb in his hand.   Into the shimmering
liquid.
It looks like deep space, filled with star fields.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
My competitors were fixated on
sucking it up, and trying to
monetize via shopping and social
media. They thought engines were a
map of what people were thinking.
But actually, they were a map of
how people were thinking. Impulse,
response. Fluid, imperfect.
Patterned, chaotic.
CALEB looks at NATHAN a moment.
Then hands him the orb back.
64.
Like I said. Because it's cool.
CALEB waits.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
And - I was thinking about your
exchange with Ava yesterday, and
our conversation afterwards.
Beat.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
I know there was a bit of heat
between us, but you actually made a
really good point. About the grey
box, and the magician's assistant.
It is a distraction, her sexuality.
It wasn't intentional, but it is
there.
NATHAN rests the mind-orb back in the skull cradle.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
This stuff we're doing together: it
can be a head-fuck. Believe me, I
know. So I thought I'd bring you
down here. Just to remind you.
Synthetics. Hydraulics. Metal and
gel. Ava isn't a girl. In real
terms, she has no gender.
Effectively, she is a grey box.
Beat.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Just a machine.
57                                                           57
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
CALEB looks at AVA through the glass.
We watch him.   And stay on him.
What lies?
Are your feelings hurt?
CALEB doesn't answer.
NATHAN shrugs.
71.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
The competition was a smoke screen.
I didn't want anyone to know what I
was doing here, or why you were
required.
As a Blue Book employee, you were
pre-screened. Loyal. And I needed
someone who would ask the right
kind of questions. So I did a
search, and found the most talented
coder in the company.
NATHAN corrects himself.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Or - second most.
He stands.    Looks up at the ice structures around them.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
You know what? Instead of seeing
this as a deception, see it as
proof.
Come on, Caleb. Fuck modesty. You
think I don't know what it is to be
smart? Smarter than everyone else
around you. Smarter than all the
other kids, jockeying for position
in school, college, work.
Beat.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
You have the light on you.   Not
lucky. Chosen.
Above them, clouds fragment and reform.
64                                                                 64
EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT
Night has fallen.
CALEB lies in the clearing, looking up at the stars.
The glow from the CIRCULAR WINDOW to NATHAN'S STUDY is like a
full moon on the grass.
72.
CALEB stands.
Looks down the light-well to NATHAN'S STUDY.
Where he sees NATHAN and KYOKO.
They are having sex.
CALEB watches.    Just for a beat.
CUT TO -
65                                                                65
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
- CALEB standing in the shower.
He shuts his eyes.
INTERCUT WITH -
- images of AVA.
Torso, hands, mouths.
FLASH OF -
- AVA and CALEB about to kiss.    But their lips never
contacting.
CUT TO -
- CALEB opening his eyes.
He exhales.
Then switches off the taps.
66                                                                66
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
CALEB enters his bedroom wearing boxer shorts.
The TV plays the live stream from the observation room.
On the screen, we can see AVA, sitting at her table, drawing.
As CALEB pulls on a T-shirt -
- behind him, on the TV, we see AVA suddenly look round.
A moment later NATHAN enters the frame.
There's no volume on the TV, so we can't hear their exchange.
Only see it.
CALEB is unaware of the silent exchange behind him.
73.
As NATHAN and AVA talk, NATHAN reaches out to AVA. His hand
touches the side of her cheek. The gesture is not quite
neutral. Feels predatory, but not unambiguously so.
Then he tugs at the material of her shirt. Pulling up the
sleeve from her wrist. Revealing the robot structure of her
arm.
AVA pulls away.       Tugs the material back down -
- and NATHAN takes a corrective movement step to regain his
balance. Showing that he is drunk.
Only now -
- CALEB turns.
And freezes.    Seeing the television.
On the screen, NATHAN reaches down to the table.
He picks up the drawing AVA was working on, and he looks at
it for a moment.
They exchange a few words.
Then abruptly NATHAN rips drawing in half.      Drops it on the
floor. Then turns, and exits.
Leaving AVA alone.
67                                                                 67
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
On CCTV, we watch CALEB walk fast down the glass corridor.
68                                                                 68
INT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - NIGHT
CALEB enters the Jackson Pollock room.
Standing by the painting, he can see KYOKO.
I already told you once. You're
wasting your time speaking to her.
CALEB turns.
NATHAN has entered.
He's holding a drink.   His words are slurred.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
However.
He walks, slightly unsteadily towards a Lutron control panel,
set into the wall.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
You would not be wasting your
time...
His hand hovers uncertainly over the buttons.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
... if you were dancing with her.
His finger lands.
Immediately, the lighting in the room undergoes a complete
change. Transforming from the discreet and tasteful low
light of evening, into the coloured glows of a night-club.
Simultaneously, from unseen speakers, DANCE MUSIC starts
playing.
CALEB stands - frozen by the surrealism of what has just
happened.
KYOKO starts walking to the center of the room.
75.
And once taken position, she starts dancing.
NATHAN calls to CALEB.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Go on!   Dance with her.
You don't like dancing?
His body is starting bob on the beat.
He gestures at KYOKO.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
She does!
Come on, man! After a hard day of
Turing Tests, you've got to unwind.
CALEB raises his voice over the sound of the music.
What?
I'm going to tear up the fucking
dance floor, dude. Check it out.
NATHAN sets off towards KYOKO.
CALEB watches, amazed, as KYOKO and NATHAN start dancing
together.
Although NATHAN is drunk, they work through the beats of a
routine they have obviously done many times before.
It's just starting to look weirdly impressive -
76.
- when NATHAN totally loses his balance.
On his way down, he lands hard on a glass coffee table.
Looking up at him, the glass frosts.
69                                                                69
EXT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
CALEB half-carries the semi-conscious NATHAN.
70                                                                70
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
NATHAN fumbles in his pocket for his KEYCARD.
Drops it.
Everything's spinning.
CALEB picks the keycard up -
- and uses it to swipe the brass plate.
The LED turns blue.
No, it's relativity.   Everything is
spinning.
CALEB hands the card back to NATHAN, who shoves it back into
his pocket.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
But being drunk does make it worse.
71                                                                71
INT. HOUSE/CONNECTING CORRIDOR - NIGHT
That's an odd question.   Wouldn't
you, if you could?
The arrival of strong artificial
intelligence has been inevitable
for decades. The variable was
when, not if. So I don't really
see her as a decision. Just an
evolution.
83.
Beat.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
I think it's the next model that's
going to be the real breakthrough.
Singularity.
CALEB reacts - but checks himself.
After Ava.
You thought she was a one-off?
Ava doesn't exist in isolation, any
more than you or me. She's part of
a continuum. Version 9.6. And
each time, they get a little
better.
A few beats of silence, except for the water falling around
them.
Download the mind. Unpack the
data. Add the new routines I've
been writing. To do that, you end
up partially formatting, so the
memories go. But the body
survives. And Ava's body is a good
one. So I'll do the same as I did
with Kyoko.
CALEB keeps his voice flat, and neutral.
Strip out the higher functions.
Then reprogram her to help around
the house and be fucking awesome in
bed. Though I'm thinking I might
hang on to the language routines
this time. It's kind of annoying
not being able to talk to her.
Beat.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
You did realise about Kyoko, right?
CALEB is poker-faced.
You feel bad for Ava?
CALEB says nothing.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Feel bad for yourself. One day,
the AIs will look back on us the
same way we look at fossil
skeletons from the plains of
Africa. An upright ape, living in
dust, with crude language and
tools. All set for extinction.
NATHAN glances back at CALEB
NATHAN (CONT'D)
See?    I really am a God.
There you go again.   Mister
quotable.
(simultaneous)
- made the atomic bomb.
NATHAN laughs.
85.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
I know what it is, dude.
Beat.
Sure.
CALEB looks down at the bottle of beer in his hand.
... What the fuck?
Suddenly - with both hands in his pockets - he loses balance,
and crashes to the ground.
Lands hard.
Lies there for a moment.
Groaning.   Blinking.    Catching his breath.
Then sees the figure of CALEB standing over him.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
... Dude.
My card.    I've lost it.
A beat.
Then CALEB reaches down. Beside where NATHAN lies.    And
picks something up from the floor.
92.
Dude.
You know what day it is?
Your last. The helicopter is
coming tomorrow morning. Eight AM.
CALEB pauses.
Time flies. But what a thing you
and I have shared. Something to
tell the grandchildren, right?
CALEB smiles.    A little tightly.
Signed their NDAs! Dude, you crack
me up. I'm not getting all maudlin
or anything. But straight up. I
will miss having you around.
Yes it has.
Oh, uh... no, I'm good.     You go
ahead.
Beat.
No.
I'm sure you've noticed - I've been
somewhat overdoing it recently.
When I woke up this morning, I told
myself: time to hit the old detox.
CALEB'S hand remains extended.     He smiles again.   More
tightly.
Hey - you want to get wasted, knock
yourself out. Literally. But I'm
on brown rice and mineral water.
A beat.
CALEB puts down NATHAN'S beer.
Then raises his own.
Cheers.
CALEB takes a single sip.
NATHAN watches.
99.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
So, anyway. Surely this is when
you tell me whether Ava passed or
if she failed.
CALEB pauses.
Collecting himself slightly.   Trying to think how to get his
plan back on track.
You going to keep me in suspense?
Is it?   You mean, she passed?
Wow.   That's fantastic.
Beat.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Although I've got to admit, I'm
surprised. I mean, did we ever get
past the chess problem, as you
phrased it? As in: how do you tell
if a machine is expressing a real
emotion, or a just a simulated one?
NATHAN pauses.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Does Ava actually like you?   Or
not.
CALEB has a cold realisation dawning.   NATHAN is playing with
him.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Though now I stop to think, there
is a third option. Not whether she
does or doesn't have the capacity
to like you. But whether she's
pretending to like you.
Yeah.
Beat.
I don't know.
NATHAN gazes at CALEB evenly.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Perhaps - if she saw you as a means
of escape.
And now CALEB knows: NATHAN knows.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
How's that beer tasting?
CALEB puts the beer down.
Silence.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Buddy. Your head has been so
fucked with.
I'm not sure, dude. When I woke up
this morning, I saw a tape of you
cutting open your arm. Smashing up
the mirror. You looked pretty
fucked to me.
I understand why you'd think that.
He steps over to CALEB, and rests a hand on his shoulder.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
But strange as it may seem, I'm
actually the guy who's on your
side.
NATHAN starts walking.
101.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Come with me. I'm going to let you
off the hook.
106                                                              106
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
NATHAN and CALEB stand in front of the computer.
On it, a clip of film is playing.
It shows the scene that CALEB witnessed two nights before, of
NATHAN entering AVA'S room, and an exchange between them.
But whereas the first time the sound was muted, this time we
can hear the audio.
You think he's watching us right
now, don't you?
Yeah. But he doesn't get an audio
feed. I didn't want you two
communicating outside of my line of
sight.
NATHAN reaches over and picks up her picture of CALEB.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
So all he can see is two people
having a chat.
NATHAN studies the picture for a moment.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
This is cute.
You were right about the hot
magician's assistant.
Misdirection. I rip her picture,
which she can then present as an
illustration of my cruelty to her,
and her love for you. And at the
same time, in full view of you
both...
As he talks, NATHAN rewinds the film clip slightly -
NATHAN (CONT'D)
... it allows me to do this.
... then FREEZES the film again.
This time, ON THE SCREEN:
AVA is reaching for her torn picture.
And NATHAN is reaching out with his hand.
And his hand is holding something.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Put a new camera in the room.
Battery powered, of course.
NATHAN unfreezes the image.
And we quite clearly see NATHAN place the object on AVA'S
bookcase.
NOTE THAT on the two previous occasions we have seen this
clip of film, we will have seen him do this action. But not
register it, instead reading the action as him drunkenly
using the shelf to steady himself.
CALEB stares at the monitor for a few moments.
Then turns.
He walks towards a chair.    And sits down.
103.
As he does so, NATHAN has started to play another clip.
CALEB can hear the audio.
Sure.
The recording stops.
CALEB feels short of breath.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
You feel stupid. But you
shouldn't. Proving an AI is
exactly as problematic as you said
it was.
You.
Beat.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Ava was a mouse in a mousetrap.
And I gave her one way out. To
escape, she would have to use
imagination, sexuality, self-
awareness, empathy, manipulation -
and she did. If that isn't AI,
what the fuck is?
CALEB looks upwards.
104.
Directly above, he sees a spot-light in the ceiling.
It dazzles him.
... Yes.
Don't get me wrong. You're okay.
Even pretty good, but -
They showed a good kid.
With a moral compass.
Shit, dude.
Hey. If a search engine's good for
anything - right?
Silence.
105.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Can I say one thing?
CALEB doesn't answer.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
The test worked. It was a success.
Ava demonstrated true AI. And you
were fundamental to that. If you
could just separate -
NATHAN cuts off.   Because AT THAT MOMENT -
- the lights and the monitors suddenly die.
108                                                            108
EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT
Through the circular window, the emergency lighting lifts up.
The window glows red.
109                                                            109
INT. HOUSE/AVA'S ROOM - NIGHT
AVA'S head turns to the door of her room.
Where, discretely, the LED by the keycard plate glows blue.
110                                                            110
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
NATHAN checks his watch.
The power cut. Must be ten
o'clock.
NATHAN glances at CALEB.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Guess Ava's going to be wondering
where you are.
CALEB says nothing.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
How was that escape going to go
down, anyway? You didn't
completely explain. You said you
were going to get me drunk, take my
card, then reprogram the security
protocols. But, reprogram them to -
what?
106.
Huh.
Beat.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Not bad.     Might have even worked.
What do you mean?
CALEB looks away from the dimmed ceiling light, to NATHAN.
... What?
At that moment, the POWER COMES BACK ON.
The lights rise.
The computer monitors come back to life.
Revealing something.
On the CCTV feed of AVA'S room, the door is open.
And on the feed of the GLASS CORRIDOR -
- AVA is walking down it.
NATHAN freezes as he sees her.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
... Fuck.
107.
Both NATHAN and CALEB simultaneously rise.
Almost as an afterthought, NATHAN lands a deceptive, fast
punch into CALEB'S solar plexus.
CALEB folds, the air forced out of him, gasping for breath.
NATHAN helps him down to the floor.
A couple of yards away is one of his curl dumbbells.
He walks over.
Picks the dumbbell up.
Spins off the weights.    Leaving him with a thick metal bar.
Then exits.
111                                                               111
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
NATHAN enters the GLASS CORRIDOR.
He sees, directly ahead of him, at the far end of the
corridor, AVA and KYOKO.
They stand together.
KYOKO'S mouth is by AVA'S ear, as if telling her a secret.
Her lips are open.   They don't move.
CLOSE UP to KYOKO'S lips, we hear a hiss of static, with soft
pulses of noise buried inside.
Then the two robot women become aware of NATHAN'S presence.
They turn to face him.
A beat.
Then AVA starts walking towards NATHAN.
NATHAN'S fingers flex around the metal bar in his hand.
Ava.
AVA doesn't slow or react.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Ava - now listen to me. I want you
to go back to your room.
AVA has reached halfway down the corridor.
She stops walking.
108.
Yes.
CLOSE UP.   On AVA.
Then AVA breaks into a run.
Sprinting in NATHAN'S direction.
112                                                              112
EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT
Quiet in the garden.
Soft wind rush.
Moon and stars reflected in the windows of the house.
112A                                                            112A
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
AVA impacts NATHAN, and they fly backwards.
Then land hard.
NATHAN gets to his feet first.
AVA tries to rise too.
And he kicks her extremely hard in the torso.
She is knocked back down.
NATHAN glances around.
There is no talking.
Just NATHAN'S laboured breathing.
Then he walks back to AVA, looking down at her.
He swings the metal bar.
AVA raises her left arm defensively -
- and shockingly, the bar smashes through it. Crushing the
delicate mesh, shattering the carbon fibre bone structure.
Breaking the arm half way down the forearm.
CUT TO -
109.
112B                                                              112B
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
- CALEB, dragging himself up, stunned by the sight on the
CCTV feed.
CUT BACK TO -
112C                                                              112C
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
- NATHAN.   Preparing to deliver a lethal blow.
But as he does so, we see something.
KYOKO.
Approaching behind NATHAN.
She's holding something in her hand.
She walks directly up to NATHAN.
And does something behind his back.
As she does so, KYOKO emits the first sound we have heard her
make. A little gasp, or sigh.
NATHAN jolts.
Aah!
He looks down.
Something is under his shirt, just above his solar plexus.       A
little ridge.
He tugs the material of his shirt open -
- and reveals a tiny triangle of metal.    Protruding from his
skin.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
What -
He turns.
The handle of a KITCHEN KNIFE is jutting out of the middle of
his back, just left of his spine. It has been jammed so deep
that the tip of the blade has poked out of his chest.
Blood soaks into his shirt material with amazing speed,
blossoming from the point of the wound.
He sees KYOKO.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Oh shit.   No.
110.
He lashes out with the metal bar.
It catches KYOKO in the jaw.
Her entire lower jaw snaps off.
It reveals metal armature, and carbon fibre, and spurting
pneumatic fluid. And something in her neck, glowing and
sparking.
Then she folds down to the ground, as her power abruptly cuts
out.
NATHAN (CONT'D)
Fucking - unreal -
As NATHAN stares down at KYOKO -
- reveal that AVA has got to her feet behind him.
She pulls the knife out of his back.
Feeling this happen, NATHAN turns -
- and AVA pushes the knife into his chest.
NATHAN stares at AVA.
Then takes a slight step away from her.
And sits down heavily on the white carpet.
Crimson drips onto bleached fibre.
Beats pass on this strange image:
KYOKO sprawled on the floor with her broken face.
NATHAN sitting upright, his upper torso now drenched in
blood.
AVA standing.   Watching NATHAN.
After a few moments, NATHAN slumps sideways.
And stops breathing.
113                                                               113
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
CALEB sees this same view, on the CCTV camera feed, on
NATHAN'S monitors.
Then -
- AVA starts walking.
As she walks, she discards the broken section of her arm.
111.
On the cameras, CALEB watches her progress through the house.
Down the glass corridor. Through the threshold to NATHAN'S
private quarters.
Then -
- CALEB raises his head from the screens.
To see AVA standing at the open door to NATHAN'S study.
AVA and CALEB look at each other.
