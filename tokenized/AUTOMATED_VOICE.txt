Caleb Smith.
CALEB tracks the source of the voice.
Near what seems to be the front door, a pillar protrudes from
the ground. Head-height. With a GLASS SCREEN on one side.
Below the screen is a DISPENSER.
Please approach the console and
face the screen.
CALEB looks into the screen, and as soon as he has locked
eyes with his own reflection, the screen FLASHES. A single
bright strobe.
Almost immediately afterwards, something small clatters into
the DISPENSER.
AUTOMATED VOICE (CONT'D)
Take your keycard.
9.
CALEB picks the object up.      It's a credit-card sized ID.
On it, there is an embedded chip, and a photograph of his
face. He looks comically surprised.
Your keycard now may be used to
enter the residence.
CALEB walks up to the front door.
Beside the door, a KEYCARD PLATE is set into the wall, with a
RED LED LIGHT.
He holds his keycard ID.
The RED LED light changes to BLUE.
CALEB pushes the front door, and it swings open.
13                                                                    13
INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
The front door opens to a glass-walled staircase, which leads
down to an open-plan room.
At the bottom of the staircase, CALEB waits to see if he is
welcomed, or noticed.
But he is not.
Power cut.     Back up power
activated.
Soft emergency lighting comes on.
CALEB hesitates a moment.
Then gets out of bed.
Goes to his bedroom door.
Beside the keycard plate, the LED is red.
He swipes it with his card.
The LED stays red.
AUTOMATED VOICE (CONT'D)
Full facility lock-down until main
generator is restored.
Full facility lock-down until main
generator is restored.
CALEB looks around his windowless room.
Which suddenly has the quality of a prison cell.
Beats pass.
Then -
- as abruptly as the power went off, it comes back again.
The emergency lighting goes off, the TV and digital alarm
clock turn back on.
AUTOMATED VOICE (CONT'D)
Power restored.
CALEB stands in the flickering TV light.
Then he tries his card again.
This time, the LED turns blue, and the door opens.    Revealing
the GLASS CORRIDOR outside.
27                                                               27
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
CALEB walks out of his room.
The glass corridor illuminates as CALEB enters.
Ahead, one of the doors off the corridor is ajar.
28                                                               28
INT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - NIGHT
CALEB enters the room with the open door.
It appears to be empty.    Still and silent.   Low lit.
Only one area is properly illuminated: a wall, on which a
large JACKSON POLLOCK drip painting hangs.
CALEB walks towards it. Studies the strange strands of
looping colour for a moment.
A TELEPHONE, on a low table.
CALEB walks over to it, with a half glance over his shoulder,
as if sensing he is doing something that - obscurely - he
shouldn't.
Then he picks up the handset.
It's dead.
31.
He hits some buttons.
It stays dead.
There is a slot by the phone.
CALEB puts two and two together. He reaches into his pocket.
Pulls out his KEYCARD. Puts it in the slot...
... and a light on the handset glows red.
Power cut.     Back up power
activated.
Then the soft emergency lighting lifts up, and throws the
observation room into a completely different light.
Weirder. Cast from LED strips on the floor, illuminating
CALEB and AVA's faces from below.
In the low light, we see a detail of AVA'S honeycomb skin-
mesh that we were not able to see before.
It glows, soft, like phosphorescence - and this changes the
way we see AVA. Where the mesh is almost invisible in bright
conditions, it is now the dominant describer of her form. So
instead of seeing AVA as a primarily robot structure, we now
see the curves and lines of a naked female body.
CUT TO -
- the CCTV CAMERAS.     Which are unpowered, hanging dead.
CUT TO -
40.
- CALEB, glancing round at the door to the room, where the
panel LED glows red.
CUT TO -
- AVA.
Watching CALEB with a strange intensity.
The vague quality of blankness in her eyes is completely
gone.
Power restored.
When CALEB looks back at AVA, she has returned to her
previous posture, facial expression, and manner.
She looks directly at CALEB, and talks, as if continuing a
conversation they have been having.
Power cut.     Back up power
activated.
For a moment, neither CALEB nor AVA react.
Then -
Power cut.     Back up power
activated.
As the emergency lighting lifts, CALEB leans forward
slightly.
