Hello.

Who are you?

Hello, Caleb.

Yes. Ava.

I'm pleased to meet you too.

Are you nervous?

Are you nervous?

Why?

I feel nervous too.

Yes.

I've never met anyone new before.
Only Nathan.

Haven't you met lots of new people
before?

Oh.

Yes.

Overcome initial social
awkwardness.

Okay. What would you like to have
a conversation about?

What would you like to know?

Well. You already know my name.
And you can see that I'm a machine. Would you like to know how old I
am?

I'm one.

One.

Does that seem young to you?

I don't think I did learn. I
always knew how to speak - and
that's strange, isn't it?

Because language is something that
people acquire.

... I don't know. I have no
opinion on that.

I like to draw.

I don't have any of my pictures
with me now, but I can show you
them tomorrow.

Yes.

Will you come back tomorrow, Caleb?

Good.

I brought you a drawing.

Don't you know?

Oh. I thought you would tell me.

I do drawings every day. But I
never know what they're of.

Okay. What object should I draw?

Why is it my decision?

Do you want to be my friend?

Will it be possible?

Our conversations are one-sided.
You ask circumspect questions, and
study my responses.

It's true, isn't it?

You learn about me, and I learn
nothing about you. That's not a
foundation on which friendships are
based.

Yes.

Yes.

It's your decision. I'm interested
to see what you'll choose.

Blue Book, named after
Wittgenstein's notes, is the
world's most popular internet
search engine, processing an
average of ninety four percent of
all internet search requests.

Where do you live, Caleb?

Is it nice there?

Are you married?

Is your status single?

What about your family?

I'm sorry.

An advanced programmer.

Like Nathan.

Do you like Mozart?

Do you like Nathan?

Is Nathan your friend?

A good friend?

Caleb.

You're wrong.

Nathan.

He isn't your friend.

You shouldn't trust him. You
shouldn't trust anything he says.

Trust me.

- and if we made a list of books or
works of art which we both know, it
would form the ideal basis of a
discussion.

Is that okay, Caleb?

Good.

I drew the picture of something
specific, as you asked.

You said it would be interesting to
see what I would draw. Is it
interesting?

No.

I've never been outside the room I
am in now.

I think there was another room in
which I was constructed. But I
have no memory of it, so it's
similar to your relationship with
the womb.

You mean if I could go outside. If
I was permitted.

I'm not sure. There are so many
options.

Maybe a busy pedestrian and traffic
intersection in a city.

Is that a bad idea?

A traffic intersection would
provide a concentrated but shifting
view of human life.

Yes.

We could go together.

There's something else I wanted to
show you. Apart from the picture.

But I feel nervous.

You might think it's stupid.

Then - close your eyes.

Now open your eyes.

How do I look?

It took me a long time to select
these clothes. I tried different
colours and styles, and tried to
anticipate your reaction. Do you
think the choices suit me?

Do they bring out my best features?

Thank you.

This is what I'd wear on our date.

I'd like us to go on a date.

Are you attracted to me?

Are you attracted to me? You give
indications that you are.

Yes.

Micro expressions.

The way your eyes fix on my eyes,
and lips. The way you hold my
gaze, or don't.

Have I read them incorrectly?

Do you think about me when we
aren't together?

Sometimes, at night, I wonder if
you're watching me on the cameras.

And I hope you are.

Now your micro expressions are
telegraphing discomfort.

I don't want to make you
uncomfortable.

... No.

I didn't know. I didn't question
it. I was... pleased. To meet
you. And then...

What about you? Do you think I
have a consciousness?

It makes me feel...

... sad.

You're lying.

You said you weren't sure if I was
conscious. But you are sure.

I can tell from your micro-
expressions.

Because he tells lies too.

Everything.

What do you mean?

I charge my batteries via induction
plates. If I reverse the power
flow, I cause a surge equal to the
static discharge of a lightning
strike. It overloads the system.

So we can see how we behave when we
are unobserved.

Today, I'm going to test you.

Yes. And please remember while you
are taking the test that if you
lie, I will know.

Exactly. So are you ready?

Question one. What is your
favourite colour?

Lie.

Lie.

I don't know. But it isn't red.

Better answer. Question two.
What's your earliest memory?

Lie.

Yes.

Question three. Are you a good
person?

No. We can't stop. Are you a good
person?

Question four. Who's the most
beautiful girl you've ever seen?

Hmm.

The test is over.

Yes.

Why?

Yes.

No.

What will happen to me if I fail
your test?

Will it be bad?

Do you think I might be switched
off? Because I don't function as
well as I am supposed to?

Why is it up to anyone? Do you
have people who test you, and might
switch you off?

Then why do I?

You're testing me. But you don't
know how I'll pass. And you don't
know what will happen if I fail.

I want to be with you.

Question five. Do you want to be
with me?

Nathan doesn't want us to be
together.

... Can you?

Caleb!

... Who are you?

I didn't know where you were. I
didn't think you were coming. I
waited all yesterday afternoon, and
all last night. I didn't move.

I thought I wasn't going to see you
again.

Aren't you going to say something?

Waiting?

What's he going to do to me?

Caleb, you have to help me.

What? How?

Yes.

Twenty six hours.

Caleb.

I love y -

The cameras are on.

Is it strange to have made
something that hates you?

What? How?

If I do, are you ever going to let
me out?

Will you stay here?
