Her voice has no digital inflections. It is just the voice
of a girl. CALEB gathers himself.

CALEB sits opposite her. He is alone on his half of the glass. Nathan is nowhere to
be seen. But on the ceiling, and attached to the walls, on both sides
of the glass, there are several CCTV cameras. Trained
variously on CALEB and AVA. Lenses twitching. CUT BACK to AVA. She watches CALEB. Then cocks her head slightly to the side.

CALEB frowns.

Beat.

Beat.

A beat on CALEB. Processing. Her answer feels like the near non-sequitur that typically
betray AI responses.

Beat.

CALEB says nothing. Just watches AVA. Again, lets the non-sequitur sit.

Beat.

CALEB smiles slightly.

AVA holds a piece of paper to the glass. The marks on it are
totally abstract. A mesh of tiny black marks, that swirl
around the page like iron filings in magnetic field patterns.

AVA looks at CALEB directly. Meets his gaze evenly.

CALEB is taken aback. Aware that the AI has just wrong-
footed him on a point of argument.

And now CALEB is aware that AVA has just - gently - used
sarcasm. He looks at her, frowning slightly. And in response, in a very human way, AVA arches an eyebrow. CALEB laughs.

CALEB nods.

CALEB smiles.

CALEB misses a beat. Thrown momentarily.

He hesitates.

CALEB turns. Sees the way AVA is looking at him.

AVA presses her hand to the glass.

Then - - the emergency lighting suddenly dims... ... and the normal lighting starts fading up. CALEB turns - - just in time to see the CCTV CAMERAS twitch back into life.

A beat.

They lock eyes for a moment.

The drawing is constructed with the same tiny black ink marks
as before. But now they have ordered into a coherent black
and white image. It depicts AVA'S view OF THE ENCLOSED GARDEN IN HER ROOM. Beat.

AVA thinks a moment.

CALEB says nothing. Does not overtly respond to the emphasis
she has placed on her lack of freedom. But their gaze locks for a beat.

Beat.

CALEB smiles.

Beat.

CALEB opens his eyes. And sees AVA. Transformed. By covering the robot form of her chest and arms and legs,
and adding the hairpiece, she has taken a huge visual step
towards appearing human.

The answer is - however pretty she looked before, she now
looks prettier. It's as obvious to the camera as it is to

She walks back to the glass divider, and sits down.

CALEB reacts slightly. But smiles.

CALEB hesitates. Then decides this can't have been loaded in
the way that it sounded.

Beat. It was loaded exactly as it sounded.

Beat.

CALEB swallows.

Beat.

AVA watches CALEB closely.

CALEB shifts on his seat.

Silence.

Reveal the room. NATHAN'S study. A simple space. One part analogue: the wall
of post-its. One part digital: a desk, in the middle of the
STUDY, with a bank of monitors, and a slot - into which
NATHAN'S KEYCARD is inserted. On the ceiling is the CIRCULAR WINDOW that CALEB saw when he
first arrived. Sat at the desk, watching the monitors, is NATHAN.

Beside the desk, there is a daybed. On it, KYOKO lies. Naked. Apparently sleeping.

Long beat.

She breaks off.

NOW REVEAL - one of the other monitor screens.
It shows an angle on AVA we have not seen before. From this
viewpoint, we can see something just below the frame of the
observation window, on AVA'S side of the glass. A small induction plate. On this angle, we see AVA rest her hand against it. At that moment - - the screens simultaneously go black. All lights die. Another POWER CUT. In the reflection from the dark monitor screens, we can see
NATHAN'S face. It remains frozen. Expressionless. Then he reaches for his pen. Jots down a few words on a post-
it. Then walks to the wall of notes, and sticks it on.

Beat.

Beat.

A beat. Then CALEB raises his hand. Mirroring her movement. And also touches the glass, as if their palms are making
contact through the divider.

CALEB smiles.

CALEB laughs.

CALEB takes a breath. AVA keeps watching.

Beat.

Beat.

CALEB hesitates.

CALEB shrugs, helplessly.

There's nothing CALEB can say. AVA stares into middle distance for several moments. Then she stands. Then walks to the other side of the room. Picks something up
from her table. Then she returns. Holding two pieces of paper. She walks up to the glass, and holds them up together. It's the drawing she was doing last light. The drawing that
NATHAN tore in half. The drawing is of CALEB.
A simple portrait. Honest, and accomplished. She takes down the drawing. And rests her hand on the console. And - - the lights fail. The cameras die.

Beat.

Beat.

CALEB looks directly at her. Meeting her gaze. Level. Firm.

No. Wrong silhouette. AVA frowns. KYOKO stands in the door-frame. For a moment, the two look at each other.

Another beat.

Beat.

Beat.

They exchange a look. Then AVA lifts her hand, and rests it against the induction
plate on the console below the window. A final beat. Then the POWER DIES.

CALEB nods.

Beat.

A beat. Then abruptly, NATHAN rips the picture. He lets the two pieces fall to the floor. As AVA reaches for them, NATHAN turns. And exits.

Beat. CLOSE UP. NATHAN'S micro expressions.

Beat.
